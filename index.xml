This means its source code can be freely reused and built upon, as long as improvements are made available to the community under the same conditions. This also means that decisions on the evolution of the product will be taken in an increasingly democratic manner as the community that builds it will grow. Its budget and ecosystem metrics are public and transparent.</description></item><item><title>Accessibility Statement</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/accessibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/accessibility/</guid><description>Accessibility Statement Established on 15 April 2024.
The Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs is committed to making its service accessible, in accordance with Article 47 of Law No. 2005-102 of 11 February 2005.
To this end, we are implementing the strategies and measures set out in the Multiannual Accessibility Plan 2021-2023 of the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs.
This accessibility statement applies to Open Terms Archive (https://opentermsarchive.org).
Compliance status Open Terms Archive is not compliant with the RGAA.</description></item><item><title>Alibaba adds disease outbreaks to its disclaimer</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/alibaba-adds-disease-outbreaks-to-its-disclaimer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/alibaba-adds-disease-outbreaks-to-its-disclaimer/</guid><description>The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic can be read right into Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s terms of service: since May 6, 2020, the marketplace specified epidemics as cases of force majeure in which it is not responsible for order delays or failures.</description></item><item><title>Budget</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/budget/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/budget/</guid><description>Budget</description></item><item><title>Call for funders and contributors on generative AI industry</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/generative-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/generative-ai/</guid><description>Proposal The generative AI industry is a globally relevant target for Open Terms Archive, considering on the one hand that it is so emergent it is mostly unregulated and will thus evolve very fast; and on the other hand that its potential for societal transformation, disruption and harm are as immense as the new opportunities it will offer.
At the same time, several national and global regulatory proposals on AI exist, but none have been adopted yet: UNESCO’s “Ethics of AI”; Council of Europe’s “Convention of AI”; EU’s “AI Act”; White House’s “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights”; China’s “AI rulebook”; OECD “AI Principles”… Legal challenges on personal data handling arise, starting with Italy and France.</description></item><item><title>Datasets</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/datasets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/datasets/</guid><description>The datasets listed here are public collections within the Open Terms Archive federated ecosystem.

In November 2022, the European Commission has finalised a report using Open Terms Archive to conduct a large-scale assessment of compliance with the P2B Regulation. In January 2022, Open Terms Archive was cited as example in support of the TLDR Act (for Terms-of-service Labeling, Design, and Readability), a US bill co-sponsored by Congresswoman Lori Trahan (D-MA-03), Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) to enforce the publication of summaries of terms of use in machine-readable formats.</description></item><item><title>Impact on consumer protection</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/consumer-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/consumer-protection/</guid><description>Achievements In the first quarter of 2022, France&amp;rsquo;s largest consumer protection association, UFC-Que Choisir, detected several irregularities in French online marketplaces thanks to Open Terms Archive tracking. They requested and obtained the correction of several non-functional links to cooling-off cancellation forms. In January 2022, Open Terms Archive was used as an example of feasibility in the TLDR Act, a bill presented to the US Congress aiming at forcing platforms to clarify their commitments towards end users.</description></item><item><title>Impact on mis- and disinformation</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/mis-and-disinformation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/mis-and-disinformation/</guid><description>Mis- and disinformation are typically addressed through reactive measures against specific attacks or proactive prevention efforts. While these approaches are necessary and valuable, they are inherently endless and fail to address the root of the problem. Exploiting vulnerabilities for political gains will always attract malign actors, outnumbering those interested in prevention.
The issue of disinformation arises from vulnerabilities in the tools that mediate the information environment. These vulnerabilities persist because fixing them conflicts with the economic incentives of large platforms.</description></item><item><title>Impact on personal data protection</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/impact/privacy/</guid><description>Achievements In September 2021, press articles objectified their investigations with data from Open Terms Archive following the collaboration of Swiss provider ProtonMail with law enforcement.</description></item><item><title>Instagram adds a posting ban to protect copyright</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</guid><description>On March 28, Instagram updated its intellectual property community rules, prohibiting the posting of content that “facilitates copyright infringement through unauthorized devices or services.” The text presents a list of cases in which users would risk infringing the copyright of a third party or even merely “facilitating” such infringement, even if they did not intend to do so. After the previously listed cases, which include “you purchased or downloaded the content” or “you saw others post the same content,” Instagram adds that users risk infringing copyright if they “use an unauthorized streaming device or service (examples: a ‘jailbroken’ or ‘loaded’ app or service).</description></item><item><title>Instagram blocks data retrieval and clarifies what information it retrieves</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</guid><description>In November 2021, Instagram made several updates to its community rules, its terms of use and its privacy policy. Among the notable developments, the platform explicitly prohibits the sale or exchange of &amp;ldquo;non-medical or pharmaceutical substances.&amp;rdquo; It says it will remove all posts promoting such products, either for sale or to indicate personal consumption, except in a healing context.
In its updated terms of service, Instagram prohibits creating accounts or using them in such a way as to retrieve information without permission, especially in an automated way.</description></item><item><title>Instagram commits to informing in case of content removal</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</guid><description>Some progress: Instagram now announces that in some cases where it removes content, the firm will notify the user and explain their options for requesting a review. Such a decision could have an impact on accounts like those of the 14 French feminist influencers who took the social network to court last year. They accused Instagram of deleting posts or accounts without giving clear explanations of the reasons for these deletions, or tools to defend themselves.</description></item><item><title>Legal notice of Open Terms Archive</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/legal-notice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/legal-notice/</guid><description>Legal notice Publisher of the Platform The Open Terms Archive Platform is published by the Office of the Ambassador for Digital Affairs located at:

Open Terms Archive is a brand name, not a common noun. It does not have a determiner. It is singular. It is not “Open Terms Archives”. It has spaces. It is not “OpenTermsArchive”. As often as possible, non-breakable spaces should be used to separate the three words, in order to avoid line breaks in the middle of the name.</description></item><item><title>Pinterest removes Privacy Shield notice without updating its modification date</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/pinterest-removes-privacy-shield-notice-without-updating-its-modification-date/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/pinterest-removes-privacy-shield-notice-without-updating-its-modification-date/</guid><description>Pinterest has removed a lengthy explanation of its data processing arrangements, which it said it was carrying out under the Privacy Shield then in place between the European Union and the United States. Until then, the company was committed to resolving any complaints about personal data processing and verifying as much as possible that its partners were also in compliance with the Privacy Shield. On July 21, 2020, this part was replaced by a simple sentence stating that personal data from the European Economic Area could be processed outside of it, without a commitment to manage complaints.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/privacy-policy/</guid><description>Privacy Policy Last updated: February 13, 2024

So, while the company claims to offer a particularly secure email service, it may find itself &amp;ldquo;forced to share the IP address&amp;rdquo; of its users with law enforcement in criminal investigations.
The day before the change, the website Paris-Luttes.info and various Internet users revealed that ProtonMail had communicated the IP addresses of users linked to the Youth for Climate group to the Swiss justice system.</description></item><item><title>Qwant details data shared with Microsoft</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/qwant-details-data-shared-with-microsoft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/qwant-details-data-shared-with-microsoft/</guid><description>On November 2, 2021, Qwant specified in its privacy policy the type of data it passes on to its partner Microsoft &amp;ldquo;for the security and reliability of its services.&amp;rdquo; Among the data that the service can share with Bing, the search engine of the American giant, are the keywords searched, the type and version of the browser used, or an identifier derived from the IP address and browser information.</description></item><item><title>Size of the federation</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/stats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/stats/</guid><description>Size of the federation Open Terms Archive is a decentralised, federated ecosystem that publicly records and analyses the terms of services of online services in different languages and countries several times a day, increasing their readability and highlighting their changes. It is designed as a tool to steer platform governance towards increased accountability, improved legislation and stronger regulatory compliance. These numbers give an idea of its growing size.

The addition can be read in light of several terrorist attacks celebrated online by their perpetrators: the Christchurch attacks had been broadcast live on the networks, as well as the Baerum massacre and then the Halle attack.</description></item><item><title>Twitter adds form and statement of jurisdictional consent to its copyright claims process</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</guid><description>On April 13, Twitter added a new condition to the issuance of a notice of dispute: it now requests the signature of a declaration of jurisdictional consent, which varies slightly depending on whether the user resides in the USA or not. For a French resident, it will therefore be necessary to attach to their information the statement of jurisdictional consent: &amp;ldquo;I consent to the jurisdiction of any court in which Twitter may be located.</description></item><item><title>Twitter clarifies its content suspensions rules and allows appeal</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/twitter-clarifies-its-content-suspensions-rules-and-allows-appeal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/twitter-clarifies-its-content-suspensions-rules-and-allows-appeal/</guid><description>Twitter clarifies that content suspension for copyright infringement only happens if the violation of its Copyright Policy is “repeated”. Such a measure cannot “vary depending on the type of services” anymore. Furthermore, Twitter introduces an appeal form.</description></item><item><title>YouTube adds health data to the information prohibited from being published</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/youtube-adds-health-data-to-the-information-prohibited-from-being-published/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/youtube-adds-health-data-to-the-information-prohibited-from-being-published/</guid><description>Since April 12, YouTube forbids the disclosure of another person’s “personal” data, and not only one’s “confidential” data. The harassment section of its French community guidelines now adds “medical records” to the examples of information a user is prohibited from divulging about a third party.</description></item><item><title>YouTube closes its fast-track content flagging program to individuals</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/youtube-closes-its-fast-track-content-flagging-program-to-individuals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/youtube-closes-its-fast-track-content-flagging-program-to-individuals/</guid><description>YouTube changed the presentation of its YouTube Trusted Flagger program, which offers more direct access to the platform to remove posts that violate its rules. It was until then intended for some NGOs, government agencies and users who effectively report content that violates the rules. It is now presented as open only to non-governmental organizations and public authorities.</description></item></channel></rss>
