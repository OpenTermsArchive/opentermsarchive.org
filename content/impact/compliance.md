### Achievements

- In March 2023, the P2B compliance trial did demonstrate the value of Open Terms Archive enough that the European Commission is now [adopting](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/issues/1001) it as a fundamental tool for its new in-house DSA enforcement team within its Joint Research Center.
- In November 2022, the European Commission used Open Terms Archive for a [large-scale assessment](https://ppmi.lt/news-insights/ppmi-has-completed-early-evaluation-p2b-regulation) of compliance with the P2B regulation.
- In January 2022, Open Terms Archive was cited as example in support of the [TLDR Act](https://www.lifewire.com/the-tldr-act-could-help-you-make-sense-of-terms-of-service-agreements-5216643) (for _Terms-of-service Labeling, Design, and Readability_), a US bill co-sponsored by [Congresswoman Lori Trahan](https://trahan.house.gov/) (D-MA-03), [Senator Bill Cassidy](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/) (R-LA), and Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) to enforce the publication of summaries of terms of use in machine-readable formats.
- Since September 2020, the French [Center of expertise for digital platform regulation](https://www.peren.gouv.fr/en/) (PEReN) uses Open Terms Archive as part of its toolset.
