### Achievements

- On 1 December 2023, the European Commission [officially](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launches-new-database-track-digital-services-terms-and-conditions) launched a new [database](https://platform-contracts.digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/index.html) based on Open Terms Archive to track the terms and conditions of digital services.
- In November 2022, the European Commission has [finalised a report](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d6a287b5-5116-11ee-9220-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/) using Open Terms Archive to conduct a large-scale [assessment](https://ppmi.lt/news-insights/ppmi-has-completed-early-evaluation-p2b-regulation) of compliance with the [P2B Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/1150/oj).
- In January 2022, Open Terms Archive was cited as example in support of the [TLDR Act](https://www.lifewire.com/the-tldr-act-could-help-you-make-sense-of-terms-of-service-agreements-5216643) (for _Terms-of-service Labeling, Design, and Readability_), a US bill co-sponsored by [Congresswoman Lori Trahan](https://trahan.house.gov/) (D-MA-03), [Senator Bill Cassidy](https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/) (R-LA), and Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) to enforce the publication of summaries of terms of use in machine-readable formats.
- Since September 2020, the French [Center of expertise for digital platform regulation](https://www.peren.gouv.fr/en/) (PEReN) uses Open Terms Archive as part of its toolset.
