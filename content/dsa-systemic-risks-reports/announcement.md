**Paris, October 3, 2025**

Open Terms Archive now archives and tracks all DSA systemic risk assessment Reports across the **21 very large online platforms** that have published them to date, creating a [dedicated dataset]({{< relref path="dsa-systemic-risks-reports">}}) for this new type of document.

Leveraging its open-source software, originally designed to monitor changes to online services’ contractual documents, the team developed a new collection that automatically archives and tracks Systemic Risk Assessment Reports published in compliance with the [EU Digital Services Act (DSA)](https://www.eu-digital-services-act.com/Digital_Services_Act_Articles.html).

Under Articles [34](https://www.eu-digital-services-act.com/Digital_Services_Act_Article_34.html), [35](https://www.eu-digital-services-act.com/Digital_Services_Act_Article_35.html) and [42§4](https://www.eu-digital-services-act.com/Digital_Services_Act_Article_42.html) of the DSA, Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines (VLOPs and VLOSEs, collectively referred to as VLOPSEs) must publish systemic risk assessment reports at least once per year. These reports identify and analyze risks stemming from their services and describe the measures taken to mitigate them.

[Rolled out in 2024](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/very-large-online-platforms-and-search-engines-publish-first-risk-assessment-and-audit-reports), this reporting obligation represents the first time VLOPSEs have publicly assessed and disclosed systemic risks in their systems. While the first round of reports set a precedent for a more informed public conversation about online risks and for platforms adopting proactive risk-management practices, report content and publishing practices have been [criticized](https://kgi.georgetown.edu/research-and-commentary/systemic-risk-assessment-under-the-digital-services-act/).

Early versions of the reports have [raised concerns](https://dsa-observatory.eu/2024/12/09/dsa-risk-assessment-reports-are-in-a-guide-to-the-first-rollout-and-whats-next/) about transparency and accessibility, including unclear publication timelines, inconsistent formats, and a lack of version history. Because the reports are hosted directly by the platforms, accessing them is often difficult or, in some cases, impossible. For instance, reports hosted by adult-content platforms are often automatically blocked by workplace IT security filters, preventing access by researchers or regulators. While the DSA requires platforms to preserve these reports for at least three years after the assessments, there is currently no mechanism to verify modifications made to published reports, and previous versions are not publicly available (the European Commission’s [DSA Reports database](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-brings-transparency) links only to the most recent report per platform). In addition, the documents themselves are often published in non-machine-readable formats such as PDF.

While the DSA does not currently require Systemic Risk Assessment Reports to be machine-readable or mandate notification of modifications to previously published versions, it **already imposes these standards** on other types of reports, such as transparency reports and could, in the future, extend them to additional categories.

In line with Open Terms Archive’s first design principle, "never trust the platforms," and its ongoing mission to strengthen transparency and research in online platform governance, the team created this dataset to:

- **Archive** all published systemic risk assessment reports, giving researchers and regulators access to all of their versions.
- **Track modifications** over time to enable verification of report updates.
- **Ensure version traceability** and document authenticity.
- **Identify** which platforms have published these required reports, and therefore which ones are not in compliance.

This project was developed collaboratively by the Open Terms Archive and CheckFirst teams during the [**Hack the DSA**](https://regulation-tech.cnam.fr/hack-the-dsa/) hackathon hosted by the **CNAM’s Chaire sur la modération des contenus** on **October 3, 2025** and was awarded second prize by a jury of experts.

This dataset currently covers systemic risk assessment reports but could be expanded to include other reports mandated by the DSA, such as transparency (article 42) or audit reports (article 37). We are looking for partners to expand coverage, reach out to <contact@opentermsarchive.org> if interested to collaborate on this expansion!
