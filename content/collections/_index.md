Collections are created and maintained by groups of interest to track the terms of services operating in specific industries, languages and jurisdictions. They enable collaboration on both data gathering and analysis. To use Open Terms Archive data, start by identifying which collection aligns with your own interests and join it, or create a new one if none matches.
