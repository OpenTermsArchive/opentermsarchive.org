**Open Terms Archive's mission is to shift the power balance from large platforms to their users and regulators.** Measuring the specific impact of Open Terms Archive in such a broad task is difficult, if not impossible. Despite these limitations, we seek to measure the effect of our efforts, both to maximise it and out of accountability to the entities that trust us.

Much of the impact of Open Terms Archive is inherently unmeasurable. In this section we refer to prominent cases that illustrate those effects that make sense when contextualised and lose meaning when reduced to a number, as their systemic impact is not linear with their occurrence.
