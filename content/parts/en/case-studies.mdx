### Protonmail clarifies its privacy policies

On September 6, 2021, ProtonMail <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/510c7d65e4254e1d53221b139d7e25bb2b990510">amended</a> its privacy policies so as to clarify the effects of Swiss laws (where the company is based) on the handling of user data. So, while the company claims to offer a particularly secure email service, it may find itself "forced to share the IP address" of its users with law enforcement in criminal investigations.

The day before the change, the website <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://paris-luttes.info/recit-policier-de-sainte-marthe-15258?lang=fr">Paris-Luttes.info</a> and various <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/OnEstLaTech/status/1434576598418796549">Internet users</a> revealed that ProtonMail had communicated the IP addresses of users linked to the Youth for Climate group to the Swiss justice system. These addresses had been requested by the French police <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/736940-protonmail-transmet-des-adresses-ip-a-la-police-4-questions-pour-comprendre-la-polemique.html">via Europol</a>. This change mirrors what the company had indicated on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/pil6xi/climate_activist_arrested_after_protonmail/hbqha63">Reddit</a>.

### Pinterest removes Privacy Shield notice without updating its modification date

Pinterest has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ambanum/CGUs-data/commit/a53e891ba">removed</a> a lengthy explanation of its data processing arrangements, which it said it was carrying out under the Privacy Shield then in place between the European Union and the United States. Until then, the company was committed to resolving any complaints about personal data processing and verifying as much as possible that its partners were also in compliance with the Privacy Shield. On July 21, 2020, this part was replaced by a simple sentence stating that personal data from the European Economic Area could be processed outside of it, without a commitment to manage complaints. The platform did not indicate in its "summary of recent changes" at the top of the document that it had made any such changes.

### Instagram blocks data retrieval and clarifies what information it retrieves

In November 2021, Instagram made several updates to its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/9998cb21b69a222540491a81dd05be19a9785891">community rules</a>, its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/9aaf5dbfc3b34d45d640b0c7f96dce3598c7bcd2">terms of use</a> and its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/927ceba3865d79cd1b123d9f4b9928b8e997070c">privacy policy</a>. Among the notable developments, the platform explicitly prohibits the sale or exchange of "non-medical or pharmaceutical substances." It says it will remove all posts promoting such products, either for sale or to indicate personal consumption, except in a healing context.

In its updated terms of service, Instagram prohibits creating accounts or using them in such a way as to retrieve information without permission, especially in an automated way. This could have an effect on the work of researchers like those of the NGO Algorithm Watch, a research project of which having already been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook/">closed by Instagram</a> in the summer of 2021. The platform also prohibits disseminating other users’ personal information.

Finally, the social network elaborates on the type of data it collects in its privacy policies: metadata about the tools used by the user, what users see or record with their camera, the posts and accounts with which they interact, as well as the frequency, duration and time of day they perform such activities. Meta's partners receive some or all of that data when their services are used.
