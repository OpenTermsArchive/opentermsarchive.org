In an [amendment to its Community Rules](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/9e02e8dc2a10ce9d388677c4ba190804bf31390f?short_path=97a74cf#diff-97a74cf182c32c5fd04a7f7ad157a172456b1e3ead0535083736fb3a8ce84c38), Twitter changed its section regarding account authenticity. The platform previously addressed only "impersonation" while it now targets all "false and misleading" identities, prohibiting "using false identities in a way that disrupts the experience of other users." In its rules on [platform manipulation](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/befac4352f27254954ef51acb9c2fa6ae0270bd5), Twitter switched from constraining "account and identity" to preventing "multiple accounts and coordination", replacing the mention of "fake accounts" with a ban on "creating a very large number of accounts" and "using automation to create accounts." Surprisingly, the platform however [removed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/056ada5513abfade20cd73458e56e41abe2f80cf#diff-3089779674bfd306d704d6da138bf9e166d07e8145f5bb30e7998f2fcdf9cdcfL161) from its anti-spam tools the possibility to ask for an official ID.

Another point of attention: Twitter stopped explicitly upholding the lack of infringement in cases where Twitter is used “under a pseudonym or with a parody, comment or fan account."

In the midst of the French presidential campaign, these changes could have an effect on activists’ accounts, especially those using astroturfing techniques: in these cases, a few people campaigning for a candidate use quantities of fake accounts to artificially inflate the importance of a topic. This was seen on the side of La République en Marche [during the mandate of Emmanuel Macron](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2019/07/06/anonymat-represailles-ciblees-et-faux-comptes-voyage-dans-la-macronie-numerique_5486029_4355770.html). Much more recently, it has been spotted [on the side of Eric Zemmour's supporters](https://www.liberation.fr/politique/lastroturfing-larme-secrete-de-larmee-numerique-de-zemmour-sur-twitter-20220203_E3CKWO2DABA7HIP7ZQIGZXBPWE/?redirected=1). Another venue for analysis: cyber-harassment. Actors like [Pen America](https://pen.org/report/no-excuse-for-abuse/) or [Stop Fisha](https://www.instagram.com/stopfisha/?hl=fr), fighting against the phenomenon, regularly call for better control of fake accounts and multiple accounts, to prevent one person from attacking another pretending to be an army.
