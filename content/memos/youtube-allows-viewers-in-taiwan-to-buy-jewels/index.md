On January 6, 2026, YouTube [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/54d22c276ceaf361b3fe95fd6e10bd52aefc7729) its *Virtual Items Program* to viewers in Taiwan. Previously, eligibility was described using the term “US viewers”, which was ambiguous and did not clearly specify whether it was based on residency or location. The updated language clarifies that eligibility is based on the user’s location.

The [Virtual Items Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/15427201?hl=en&sjid=18056223716587959946-EU) is a microtransaction mechanism that allows viewers to purchase bundles of *Jewels*, which they can transform into digital items. These items can then be sent as tokens of ‘appreciation in real-time’ during vertical live streams. Items received by the creator, as *Rubies,* are converted into Google AdSense credit at a rate of 1 Ruby per USD0.01. [Google AdSense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AdSense) is an online advertising program provided by Google platform.
