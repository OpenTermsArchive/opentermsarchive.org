Cursor [added](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/b197079f729d0056f31e8d9a12ef13283773c507) a description of the limitations of suggestions generated by AI models, warning that they may contain “errors or misleading information”, lack creativity, misinterpret linguistic nuances, fail on complex tasks, or reflect biases in their training data, and that users bear all risks associated with using them.

In the same update, Cursor also introduced a list of use restrictions, including bans on reverse engineering, resale, data scraping, and using the service to train competing models. **Users are required to not send any prompt containing personal or payment data, and to report any unauthorized use and cooperate** in stopping it.
