The platform may also withhold payments for policy violations, and these changes appear aligned with the new EU TTPA regulation on transparency and targeting of political advertising.

Kick [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/b92d4f74d620b9972d4768b6315553e9499e632c) its political activity rules to explicitly **prohibit using platform content or tools to make or deliver financial contributions for political purposes**. This means that features such as subscriptions, gifting, or other monetization tools cannot be repurposed for campaign financing or related activities.

The update also clarifies that Kick may withhold payments if it determines its policies have been breached. This gives the platform broader discretion over the financial flows linked to creators’ activities.

These changes appear closely aligned with the [new EU transparency and targeting of political advertising, or TTPA (Regulation 2024/900](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/900/oj/eng)), which seeks to tighten rules around the use of digital platforms for political communication and funding. Kick’s revised terms signal an effort to limit liability and ensure compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks.
