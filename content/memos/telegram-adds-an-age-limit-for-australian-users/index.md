Telegram slightly [changed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/eec51f63d0fe52a2b4c3a23a5544fc4b52dbb79b) the minimum age requirement for signing up for its service. Previously, the wording stated that ‘citizens of EU countries and the United Kingdom’ had to be at least 18 years old to use the platform. However, the updated version now refers to ‘users’ instead of ‘citizens’. This modification means that the restriction is based on location rather than nationality. Users in Australia are now subject to the 18-year-old threshold.

[Australia's Online Safety Act 2021](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6680) introduced age verification. Telegram was [fined](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/24/australian-esafety-telegram-fine-reporting-delay) AUD 957,780 for non-compliance in February 2025. Since November, Telegram has been [challenging](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/telegram-sues-australia-over-age-102715194.html) the fine on technical, legal and freedom of speech grounds.

[Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)) is a messaging application founded by Nikolai and Pavel Durov, two Russian entrepreneurs. Telegram has come under intense scrutiny around the world for being a platform that [facilitates many illegal activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)#Criticism), including [the sale of illegal pornography and the drug trade](https://www.404media.co/how-telegrams-founder-pavel-durov-became-a-culture-war-martyr/). Marketed as a privacy-focused messaging app, it also benefits Durov's [anti-Putin reputation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-telegram-kremlin-pavel-durov/2020/06/27/4928ddd4-b161-11ea-98b5-279a6479a1e4_story.html) and the company’s ["refusal to hand over data in response to lawful orders"](https://www.404media.co/telegram-changes-policy-says-it-will-provide-user-data-to-authorities/). Since then, and especially since Durov’s arrest by the French authorities, Telegram has started [cooperating](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/01/08/telegram-gave-more-user-data-to-french-authorities-after-founder-s-arrest_6736824_13.html) with government agencies and [modifying](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/telegram-expands-forbidden-uses-data-disclosure-authorities/) its policies.
