LinkedIn [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/a58058977951278dcf908f987dc2f8c307da1178) its Privacy Policy to expand the scope of cross-service sharing by stating that LinkedIn may receive information from Microsoft Corporation about user engagement with Microsoft services (e.g., Outlook), instead of only sharing data. The affiliates list now explicitly includes GitHub, Inc. among Microsoft-controlled entities. The language regarding targeted advertising and data use across services has been refined to state that LinkedIn may use engagement data from its affiliates to improve ad-targeting tools, while the policy also clarifies that users may opt-out of these practices at any time.

We note that Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in December 2016.
