In a minor modification to its Commercial Terms, Pinterest [replaced](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/8e804db6dd6b38e78a28e8ee3e050c2645342434) an advertising category that was prohibited from being shown in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. ‘Brick-and-mortar casinos’ are replacing ‘brick-and-mortar pharmacies’.
