Pinterest [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/5fcad164ce434a01d3730e1d3ffcb24a354c847b) its *Marketplace Sellers Conditions* to permit the promotion of alcoholic beverages in its shopping ads. The change mentions that alcohol advertising must comply with local jurisdictions, such as those regarding legal age restrictions. It also includes a comprehensive list of countries where such advertisements are prohibited. Lastly, it sets down global rules outlining the prohibition of targeting minors and restricting positive alcohol consumption discourse.
