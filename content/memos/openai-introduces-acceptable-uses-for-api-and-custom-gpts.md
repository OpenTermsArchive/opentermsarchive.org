OpenAI re–[categorised](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/8cf83dcc3d59265f901db93f5408ea98876dabc3) their Acceptable Use Policy into three distinct lists of prohibitions.

So called “Universal” prohibitions integrated the preexisting restrictions, rephrases with added examples.

GPT API users were prohibited from soliciting sensitive identifiers from end users, taking unauthorised action on their behalf, using third-party content without authorisation, misrepresenting the purpose of their GPT and building GPT targeting individuals under 13 years old. Violation might result in “warnings, sharing restrictions, or ineligibility for inclusion in the GPT Store or monetisation”.

Restrictions for marketing on the GPT Store ban profanity in GPTs names or graphic violence in their logos. GPTs aimed at “fostering romantic companionship or performing regulated activities” were banned.
