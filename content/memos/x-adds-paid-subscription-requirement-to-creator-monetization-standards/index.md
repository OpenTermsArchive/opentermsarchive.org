X [revised](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/89a2260d081ba3c2d75305d173eb809eb1aaffbe) its Creator Monetization Standards by replacing its reference to the Brand Safety Policies with the broader Content Monetization Policies, and by introducing a new eligibility condition. Creators must now have an active Premium, Premium Business, or Premium Organizations subscription to qualify for monetization. All other eligibility requirements, such as maintaining good standing and completing identity verification, remain unchanged.
