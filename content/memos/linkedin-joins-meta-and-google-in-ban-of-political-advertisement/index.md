The LinkedIn policy banning misleading content [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/74bc03d153823a9b1412b3d871753074c67b782c) to include a ban on **sponsored "political advertisements, endorsements, or support posted in exchange for money or personal benefit"**.

LinkedIn is a Microsoft-owned professional networking site. It organizes itself around the sharing of resumes and the presentation of user-generated content that are displayed in an algorithmically arranged timeline. Changes and new requirements for political advertising on the platform were [announced](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a8013156) earlier during the summer.

In 2024, the European Union [introduced](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/transparency-and-targeting-of-political-advertising.html) the *Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising* (TTPA) regulation. It imposes specific requirements on platforms to provide data and reporting on distribution of political content through their advertising network.

In response to the implementation of the TTPA, [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/07/ending-political-electoral-and-social-issue-advertising-in-the-eu/) and [Google](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/16409999?hl=en) also banned political advertisements in the EU on their respective platforms. Google completely [removed](https://www.404media.co/google-ad-transparency-european-union/) EU countries from their political advertisement library. The content ranged from 2018 to September 28, 2025.
