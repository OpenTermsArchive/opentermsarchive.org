OpenAI [prohibited](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/d9d49b2d5e5354590a50a181cb3034b888f7d03d) the modification, copying or leasing of its services as well as the circumvention of their services’ security measures. It also limited its liability by requiring users to warrant rights in their inputs and by clarifying that the output shall not be seen as factual information or as OpenAI’s opinion.

OpenAI prohibited the use of the output for “any purpose that could have a legal or material impact on [a] person, such as making credit, educational, employment, housing, insurance, legal, medical, or other important decisions about them”.

At the same time, OpenAI established an appeal mechanism, enabling users with suspended or terminated accounts to contact the support team for resolution.
