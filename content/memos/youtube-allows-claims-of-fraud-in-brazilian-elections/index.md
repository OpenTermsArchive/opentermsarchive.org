YouTube [removed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/40ef6fea4de2f8b21098cb390db286facb33f484) an explicit prohibition regarding content advancing false claims about the integrity of past elections. The Brazilian presidential election was the last example in the guideline.

Previous versions also [included](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/9c526ada56c246f42b06d549a23f71577bfa9eba) the US presidential elections and German federal elections. YouTube [announced](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/us-election-misinformation-update-2023/) in 2023 that they would "stop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past US Presidential elections".

The 2026 presidential election in Brazil will take place on October 4th. In the previous election in 2022, YouTube and Facebook were [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/20/brazil-election-disinformation-youtube-facebook) as platforms used for disseminating misinformation and voter suppression, despite their claims of significant resource allocation.
