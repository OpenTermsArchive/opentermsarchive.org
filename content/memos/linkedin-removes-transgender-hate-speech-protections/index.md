LinkedIn [removed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/537447facc3a1922e77cfc7fe90b0fc69414b613#diff-88386d527dff09b9311f1e66713dff8eebbf339a52952a1b2376eb198d34a60fL313) transgender-related protections from its policy on hateful and derogatory content. The platform **no longer lists “misgendering[^misgendering] or deadnaming[^deadnaming] of transgender individuals” as examples of prohibited conduct**. It also removed “race or gender identity” from its examples of inherent traits for which negative comments are considered harassment.

The “last update” date of the [Hateful and Derogatory Content](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339812/?lang=en-US) was updated, but the service did not otherwise communicate publicly on this change in its [Trust &amp; Safety blog](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/trust-and-safety), like [it did](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/trust-and-safety/evolution-enforcing-our-professional-community-policies-at-scale) for example to describe how it improved enforcement of its community guidelines at scale.

At the time of writing, this change is only visible in the English version of LinkedIn’s Community Guidelines. The other languages, in particular the [French](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339812/?lang=fr-FR), [German](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339812/?lang=de-DE) and [Spanish](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339812/?lang=es-ES) versions have not evolved in the last 3 years, according to the company. Open Terms Archive [data](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commits/main/LinkedIn/Community%20Guidelines.md) confirms that no other change was recorded since May 8, 2023, where tracking started.

This change in the social network policies makes its owner Microsoft join a broader trend among U.S.-based platforms of **scaling back hate speech protections, in particular for transgender users**. Meta made a similar move on January 7, 2025 by removing a number of hate speech protections, including for gender identity, as Open Terms Archive [had reported](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-dampens-hate-speech-policy/). This shift aligns the tech sector’s policies in the United States of America with the Trump administration that has implemented an “all-of-government approach to target [the] transgender community”, as CNN [recapped](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/21/health/trans-community-trump-all-of-government) last week.

[^misgendering]: Misgendering is the act of referring to someone with a gender that does not match their gender identity.

[^deadnaming]: Deadnaming is the act of calling a transgender or non-binary person by their birth name or other former forename (their “deadname”) after they have chosen a new name. Many transgender people change names as part of gender transition, and wish for their former name to be kept private. — _CC-BY-SA [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming)_
