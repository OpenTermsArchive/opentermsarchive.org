On June 14, Facebook [backdated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/430f4a67045323a8c862808eb046b7ea8616842b) the last update of its terms of use: rather than 4 January 2022, when Facebook was renamed Meta, it now states that the last revision goes back to... December 20, 2020, over one year earlier!
