First, Murf [ceased](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/de437963aac5969e1af7bff0fb48a2aa890ad188) to grant a license for the use and display of their logo/marks only to identify that the Generated Content originates from Murf.

Additionally, they stopped committing to presenting usage costs in their user interface.

Finally, Murf eliminated the requirement for API-users to seek approval from Murf for their descriptions of future API uses. Instead, Murf referenced a "review" process for the submitted descriptions of API usage by users.
