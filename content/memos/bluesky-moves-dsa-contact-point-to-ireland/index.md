Bluesky Social [relocated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/b1a978f22b73067d9b08ea5cf37fd752fcc6139d) its contact point for the Digital Services Act (DSA) competent authorities from Belgium to Ireland. This change implies that **requests from EU authorities will only be accepted in English, while they were previously also accepted in French**.

This modification reinforces the existing trend of concentrating DSA-related responsibilities under the Irish authority Coimisiún na Meán, which already oversees many major digital platforms due to their European headquarters being located in Ireland.
