TikTok [replaced](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/6b2dd761c9564ebf0794a1173176f1cc229e9966) its former Payment Management section with a new Ad Serving Policy, marking a shift from simple billing procedures to a full operational framework for advertising. The update formalizes how ads are booked, served, modified, and compensated, and thus establishes clear, enforceable rules for bidding, asset delivery, and cancellations.

The policy sets default bidding currencies (U.S. dollars for TikTok for Business and renminbi for ByteDance China Ads) and applies automatic exchange-rate conversions for bidding. It defines strict submission timelines for reservation ads: takeover campaigns must send assets at least ten days before launch, and in-feed ads five days in advance.

TikTok specifies that delivery metrics are determined primarily by its own data, with third-party measurement accepted only within a ±20 percent margin. Creatives cannot be modified after submission, and advertisers must provide proof of copyright or licensing for any protected materials.

A new Disclaimer section limits TikTok’s responsibility when advertisers miss deadlines, submit faulty creatives, or use malfunctioning landing pages. The platform warns that universal links may trigger ad suspension. A Make-Good Policy introduces defined compensation for under-delivery: TikTok will grant 1:1 media value for standard ads that deliver below 80 percent of the goal, while sponsorships are excluded.

The change reflects TikTok’s move toward a more standardized and transparent advertising framework, similar to the operational policies long established by Meta and Google.
