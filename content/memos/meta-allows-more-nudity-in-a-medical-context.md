Since June 13, Facebook [specifies](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/200fae809ed553d6882bef3659b4544fac37e322#diff-f5b2499012804c371ee8d35d8a109e0b7a91f6a2d6d7736ab9857bfd331dbf68R23-R26) that posts with visible genitals or stimulated female nipples are acceptable if the post is about a medical or health-related issue. Meta changed the same elements in the Instagram community rules.

This may be a further reaction to criticism of the moderation logic of the company's platforms, which more easily allow male nipples to be shown than female ones. This has led to recurring removal of breast cancer prevention campaigns (as in [2014](https://www.lequotidiendumedecin.fr/actus-medicales/sante-publique/ces-seins-que-facebook-ne-saurait-voir), [2016](https://www.lemonde.fr/le-monde/article/2016/10/12/mammographie-et-facebook-du-choix-d-image-et-de-ses-consequences_5995671_4586753.html), [2018](https://www.lepoint.fr/high-tech-internet/facebook-une-moderation-a-geometrie-variable-21-07-2018-2238056_47.php), and even [2021](https://www.blogdumoderateur.com/facebook-conseil-surveillance-moderation-contenus-litigieux/)).
