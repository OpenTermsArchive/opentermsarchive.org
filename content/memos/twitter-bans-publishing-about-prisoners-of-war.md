Starting April 5, Twitter [will ban](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/d02a5431f787dcd58dc037497c06beed65c0c897?short_path=9696c1d#diff-9696c1df7dd16cea30f236779e0093c85e13ecc25835f5d9050a24b2f7479140) publishing "media showing prisoners of war published by government or state-affiliated media accounts" as part of their policy preventing content related to a person from being published without their consent.

This could impact coverage of the conflict by media outlets like Russia Today or Sputnik, which are notoriously linked to the Russian government.
