Instagram goes into [more detail](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/versions-france/commit/b8b71e45d56728242ce7c5da3e8b7ef790eec57a#diff-311682cd6d20df952901439aefad05738f09eb8ca4f505b3af21ce20ff70f23aR37) about its use of user data. While it used to simply state that it uses the information available to us to develop, test and improve our Service, Instagram now adds that it includes “analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features”.
