The company reserves the right to withhold payments or modify monetization tools, while clarifying that digital assets (KICKs, gifts, subscriptions) are licenses rather than property that cannot be sold, transferred, or refunded and may be forfeited upon account termination.

Kick [introduced new terms](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/b92d4f74d620b9972d4768b6315553e9499e632c#diff-a62c3f8b55814267dfa7d1f648f53d83aa299b92da6377854f61bd6b5c070d92R116) governing how platform content and tools can be commercialized. While creators may use features such as subscriptions or gifting, the company reserves the right to withhold payments or alter the tools at its discretion. This reinforces Kick’s exclusive control over the commercial use of its service.

The update also clarifies the status of "digital content" on the platform. KICKs (the in-app currency), Gifts, and subscriptions are treated as licenses rather than property. They cannot be sold, transferred, or refunded (except where required by law), and may be forfeited if an account is terminated. Kick also reserves the ability to discontinue or modify these digital items without compensation.

The wording shift from “monetization” to “commercialization” appears to be part of this broader clarification, aligning all language around commercial use rather than marking a distinct legal change.
