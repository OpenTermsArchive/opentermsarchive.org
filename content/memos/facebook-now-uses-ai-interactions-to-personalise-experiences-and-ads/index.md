Facebook [included](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/)\* AI at Meta as a Meta Product to which its privacy policy now applies. The generative AI features and experiences across Meta Company Products are collectively referred to as AI at Meta. The platform will collect information from interactions with AI at Meta, and also share it on Meta Products and with integrated partners. These interactions will include prompts, responses received, actions requested, and feedback given to AI. Facebook will also record information provided by others about a user to AI at Meta, including messages and content that the user may have shared.

In the revised policy, information collected across Products will be used to personalise features, content, and ads in AI at Meta, among other Meta Products. The information will also be shared with other Meta Companies to personalise features and integrations.

Furthermore, interactions with AI at Meta and related metadata such as content and messages will be used for purposes such as personalising and improving Meta Products, promoting safety, integrity, and security, providing measurement, analytics, and business services, personalising ads on Meta Audience Network, undertaking research for social good, and sharing information with others, including law enforcement.

Information collected from user activities on Meta products including posts, comments, audio etc, interactions with AI at Meta, and information from partners, vendors, and third parties, will all be used for the newly introduced purpose of developing and improving AI at Meta. Facebook removed the clarification that it will not share personally identifying information, such as username, unless included in messages to the AIs, with third-parties.

Besides the updates in use of data from AI at Meta, Facebook has also expanded information collection on users’ connections and interactions both on and off Meta Products, and on the online or in person use of third party products and services. The platform added data providers as a third-party public source for datasets which will now be additionally used for undertaking analytics.

The policy no longer provides details of information used to decide which ads and commercial content to show. It also removed factors that influence the personalisation of Facebook Feed and links to manage it. The policy clarifies now that search engines and other third parties use public content about a user (name, username, profile picture, etc.) according to their own terms and policies, not Meta's. Finally, for non-account holders, Facebook added that it can remove content that violates their terms and policies.

Meta is among the several major platforms that have [introduced](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/are-tech-companies-using-your-private-data-to-train-ai-models) updates related to AI data use, including Google, LinkedIn, and Open AI. Given this shift, researchers have [highlighted](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/10/ai-chatbot-privacy-concerns-risks-research) concerns such as privacy risks, manipulation using vulnerabilities, and a [lack of users' control](https://bostoninstituteofanalytics.org/blog/meta-will-begin-using-ai-chatbot-conversations-to-target-ads/) over their data and experience on platforms.
