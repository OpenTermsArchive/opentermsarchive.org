Shein [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/ee34c705765e374dbbda71784154cdf778a553ec) its return and refund policies, providing more specific details in its general conditions of sale. It clarified that the return period will vary based on third-party sellers, if applicable. This language is typical and consistent with other similar documents.

Return and refund rules are strictly defined in [Europe](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/return-refund-laws-eu/). In contrast, in the [United States](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/return-refund-laws-usa/), they are more flexible and demand clarity only as a best practice.

[Shein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shein) is a rapidly growing Chinese online marketplace that initially specialized in fast fashion products but also extended into other kinds of goods. In the context of low-cost fast fashion, return and refund policies are crucial due to lax quality control standards and misleading product pages. Shein also [attempted](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/11/05/shein-opens-first-permanent-store-in-paris-amid-heavy-police-presence_6747136_7.html) to open a physical store in Paris, which sparked significant controversy.
