Meta platforms Instagram and Facebook [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/0b6452bedc4000b9731c127c34dd6f4651e59794) the signals considered and actions taken to prevent child abuse. **Accounts may now be disabled entirely upon liking or saving content**, whereas the previous version of the guidelines only referred to restricting access to certain products and features after “interactions” with infringing content.
