Pinterest has [removed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/5c4741bf3205c80defe32bffbe097344745b51b0) its previous exceptions for nudity shown in artistic, scientific or historical contexts, as well as for **breastfeeding and mastectomy-related content**. All nudity is now treated in the same way as pornography and banned. The modified section previously stated: “nudity in paintings and sculptures and in science and historical contexts is okay. Content about breastfeeding and mastectomies is also allowed.” This paragraph has been fully deleted.

At the time of writing, this change only appears in the [American English](https://policy.pinterest.com/en/community-guidelines) version of the Guidelines. Versions in European language such as [French](https://policy.pinterest.com/fr/community-guidelines), [Spanish](https://policy.pinterest.com/es/community-guidelines) or [German](https://policy.pinterest.com/de/community-guidelines) have not changed, nor the [British English](https://policy.pinterest.com/en-gb/community-guidelines) version.
