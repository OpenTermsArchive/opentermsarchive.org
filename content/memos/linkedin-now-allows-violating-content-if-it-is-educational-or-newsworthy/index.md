LinkedIn [specified](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/891a208f02e1b57bff516e4caa8a4ad5abeadb88#diff-88386d527dff09b9311f1e66713dff8eebbf339a52952a1b2376eb198d34a60fR44) that it will allow otherwise prohibited content to remain on the platform if it is educational or newsworthy. This could include graphic depictions of an occupation, content on an event like war or armed conflict, or statements or actions by public officials. The platform will determine newsworthiness by balancing the content’s potential harm against the value it brings to members. The policy also clarified that any graphic or disturbing newsworthy or educational content will include a warning screen.
