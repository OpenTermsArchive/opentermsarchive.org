Since May 20, Open Terms Archive notes that LinkedIn's Community rules are no longer accessible in French —or any other language. Those pages seem to have vanished: even when manually changing language, the page redirects to the English version of the [Community Guidelines](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies).
