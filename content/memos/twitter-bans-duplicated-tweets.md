Twitter [added](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/0bf0a8f85460f936781141bfaf764183867d0685) a ban on "Tweeting an existing phrase or content in a duplicative manner, whether individually or in concert with other accounts". The change was added as Twitter updated a longer explanation of its reinforced fight against "copypastas", both in the [English](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/copypasta-duplicate-content) and the [French](https://help.twitter.com/fr/rules-and-policies/copypasta-duplicate-content) versions of its Platform integrity and authenticity rules.

Such a rule should help limit astroturfing practices such as those [used by Eric Zemmour's teams](https://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2022/video/2022/02/02/comment-des-militants-d-eric-zemmour-gonflent-artificiellement-la-presence-du-candidat-sur-twitter_6112033_6059010.html) during the French presidential election. The decision can also be read in light of [Elon Musk's latest statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/08/musk-bots-on-twitter/): the billionaire said he wants to remove spam bots, once his Twitter takeover is completed.
