LinkedIn [increased](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ie-versions/commit/50dcbecfd7c391c0aaa4cf0db72ffc9763f85cd3#diff-76a551146a4ec374ed641f47021ce1c496ae80172cccb4a4e8049e2a2085785fR510) personal data use for training its content-generating AI models under the legal basis of “Legitimate Interests” for the platform. This change is applicable to residents of the EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland. LinkedIn allows users to opt out of having their data used for this purpose at any time. Within the existing purpose of general AI features, LinkedIn added use of personal data points from profiles such as work and volunteer experience, people and companies you follow, and licenses and certifications, along with adding conversation data from Generative AI features (GAI), member generated content, data related to service use, and inferences about users. 

The platform removed the earlier distinction of not using personal data for training and improving their AI systems for content creation. It introduced new purposes for personal data collection and use under the “Legitimate Interests” legal basis: offering content-generating GAI features to members, training these features, and improving LinkedIn's products and services. For these, it will use data from profiles, activities, conversations with GAI features, member generated content, data related to service use, inferences about users, group activity and messages, connections and group memberships, feedback provided on services including AI features, and data provided when users contact or request support from LinkedIn. 

For UK residents, the policy specifies sharing data with Microsoft (LinkedIn’s parent company) for training Microsoft’s AI model. This data includes posts, comments, articles, collaborative articles and videos, company page data, and job postings. Users can again opt out of this data use at any time.
