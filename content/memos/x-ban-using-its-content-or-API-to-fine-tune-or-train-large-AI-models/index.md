In the Reverse Engineering and other Restrictions of use, X’s developer terms  strictly banned using the X API or X Content to fine-tune or train a foundation or frontier model.

By [restricting access to the data](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/5453af28fd27c1ea2ba71a72ae0514bb4df9c384), X was likely aiming to protect the competitive value of the tweets ensuring that only the company could use X’s content for developing and fine-tuning their own AI models. X could also potentially monetize its user-generated data through exclusive deals with chosen partners.
