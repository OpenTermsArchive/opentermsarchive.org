To report tweets that are considered spam or impersonation, users previously had to go to the tweet and then use the "report tweet" feature. [Now](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/056ada5513abfade20cd73458e56e41abe2f80cf?short_path=3089779#diff-3089779674bfd306d704d6da138bf9e166d07e8145f5bb30e7998f2fcdf9cdcf) they can use [a form](https://help.twitter.com/fr/forms/authenticity/impersonation) without having to have a Twitter account.
