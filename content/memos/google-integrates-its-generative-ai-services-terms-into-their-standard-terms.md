Google [integrated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/5dc544475a9dd326f2ce7f107a89cb94c5f14cb6) all provisions of its Generative AI Additional Terms of Service into their main Terms of Service. Starting on 22 May 2024, the additional terms “no longer apply, unless you’re a business partner with a signed agreement that references these terms.”

This move is emblematic of the broader industry trend that considers Generative AI as a generic component of provided tools and services, as opposed to a separate set of services.
