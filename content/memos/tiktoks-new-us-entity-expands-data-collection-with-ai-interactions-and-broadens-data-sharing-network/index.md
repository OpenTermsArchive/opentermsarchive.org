TikTok has recently [established](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/tiktok-rewrites-all-terms-following-usa-operations-transfer/) a majority US-owned joint venture entity, *“TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC”*, in the United States. The [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/ead840fe377f24345b833cdf770cde7e3cd398c3) privacy policy for this US entity (also applicable to Tiktok Ad Network) replaced all references to the "Platform" with "Service". It now includes data collection from AI interactions. The [tracking](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/tiktok-expands-data-collection-in-europe-the-united-kingdom-and-switzerland/) of precise location information if location services for the TikTok app are enabled has been part of the policy in Europe, the United Kingdom and Switzerland since October, 2025.

The data collection through usage information has also been expanded to include the duration and frequency of use of the Services, engagement with other users, and information about interactions with websites while using the in-app browser. It will collect further data through sellers as well as payment and transaction fulfilment providers, such as payment confirmation details, and information about the delivery of products purchased through TikTok’s shopping features. 

The Service has added shopping features and age verification as purposes for data collection, and widened information sharing with several new Service Providers and Business Partners such as TT Commerce & Global Services LLC and its affiliates to facilitate a global and interoperable experience, sellers and their service providers, and third-party platforms and partners. The policy states that the U.S. entity will share certain data with international TikTok operations for interoperability in compliance with applicable laws.

This establishment of a US-based entity for TikTok has come into place to address national security concerns and avoid a potential [ban](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tiktok-reaches-deal-new-us-joint-venture-avoid-american-ban-2026-01-23/).
