Midjourney introduced an explicit [prohibition](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/2cb30a2b4b338a4dffbeab9add8262cec78a3062) regarding the infringement of others’ intellectual property rights in its conditions for service availability and quality, mentioning the possibility of legal action and permanent ban from the service.

Previously, legal action was only mentioned where the violation of intellectual property rights resulted in financial detriment to Midjourney.
