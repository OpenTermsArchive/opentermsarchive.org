Meta has been busy lately: the company first [added](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/c57c282d0b75a479da787f7a2e8d1f9ee333d72a) a notice on May 17 announcing that it would change its Terms of Services on July 26. However, the link that was supposed to show the upcoming changes did not work. On May 25, the mention [disappeared](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/a1be6b0ee835d067402513d24586e7216acf6008). The day after, a new sentence appeared in both Instagram and Facebook's Privacy policies, stating “We have updated our policy.” On Facebook, the link leads to [a page](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy) mentioning an effect date of July 27, 2022. On Instagram, the [link](https://help.instagram.com/privacy/policy) to the new Privacy policies still does not work.
