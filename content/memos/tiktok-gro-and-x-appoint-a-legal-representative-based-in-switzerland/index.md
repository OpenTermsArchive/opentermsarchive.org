TikTok, Gro, and X added a legal representative based in Switzerland in order to comply with Article 14( par. 1) of the Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), in force since September 2023, which requires companies based abroad to do so under certain cumulative conditions, in particular when large-scale and regular processing and "high risk" is carried out. Until now, the representative was the same as the one in the European Union. In practice, this obligation applied to only a small number of representatives.
