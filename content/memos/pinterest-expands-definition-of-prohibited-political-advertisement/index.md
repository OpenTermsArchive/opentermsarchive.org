html_description: Pinterest expanded its restrictions on political advertising, specifically targeting ads designed to influence EU voting behavior or referendum outcomes. This defensive response to the European TTPA regulation (2024/900) reflects a broader trend where platforms prefer exiting the political advertising market rather than complying with new transparency requirements.

Pinterest [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/760688a44c2157ef627f6667f324f143e07fa15e) its restrictions on political advertising, adding cases of “ads designed or likely to influence voting behaviour within the EU” or “the outcome of a referendum or a legislative or regulatory process”.

The specificity of these provisions, whereas others encompass a wide range of topics such as fundraising, merchandizing and legislation, hints at a defensive interpretation of European policies. Indeed, the EU [regulation on transparency and targeting of political advertising (2024/900 “TTPA”)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/transparency-and-targeting-of-political-advertising.html) came into effect on October 10, 2025, imposing transparency requirements.

Regulation 2024/900 TTPA does not propose banning political advertising. Instead, it establishes guidelines to protect EU citizens from targeted influence, with the aim to “allow them to know whether they have received a targeted advertisement” and making “all online adverts […] available in an online European repository”. However, many global digital platforms prefer to leave the political advertisement market in the EU (such as [Google](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/16409999?hl=en) and [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/07/ending-political-electoral-and-social-issue-advertising-in-the-eu/)) or even globally (such as [LinkedIn](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedin-joins-meta-and-google-in-ban-of-political-advertisement/) and [Kick](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/kick-restricts-political-activity-and-strengthens-payment-controls/)) rather than complying with the TTPA.
