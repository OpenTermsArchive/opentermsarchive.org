OpenAI [postponed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/417bd95e82655cc88182e8929eb199fb86ed4edf) the effective date of its new non-European terms of service from December 14 2023 to January 31 2024.

In November 13 2023, they implemented tailored terms for European and business users, added new functionalities, imposed use restrictions, limited liability, and [established]({{<relref path="openai-enables-transfer-of-control-of-non-european-accounts-to-their-employer">}}) appeals mechanisms. These changes were supposed to be effective on December 14 2023.

This delay could be related to the delays in adopting the EU AI Act, which is not to happen before 2024.
