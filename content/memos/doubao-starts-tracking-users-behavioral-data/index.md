Doubao [added](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/c799b6fce756dfc6894a2537db01d71d91a4f776) personalized recommendations for prompts and chatbots and personal data collection requirements, with an opt-out option.

For this purpose, Doubao started collecting personal data, such as behavioral information (users’ clicks, searches, browsing, sharing…), and information provided by partners.
