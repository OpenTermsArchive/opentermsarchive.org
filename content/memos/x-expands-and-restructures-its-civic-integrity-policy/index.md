X has [revised](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/d39ef3f9b09a5a4d9cacf999be20c6fd2047cfc6) its Civic Integrity policy with substantial changes to how it defines civic processes and how it structures its rules against misleading or suppressive content. The update reorganizes the section under the new title “Civic Integrity” and introduces a clearer, more formal definition of what constitutes a civic process. X now explicitly lists political elections, censuses, major referendums, and ballot initiatives as events covered by the policy.

The revised introduction outlines the policy’s purpose as addressing misleading content that could affect participation in elections or other civic processes, including information that may confuse users about how, when, or where to take part. This reframing moves the policy toward a more preventive orientation.

Furthermore, the policy reorganizes prohibited behavior into clearer categories, replacing earlier detailed examples with broader groupings. These include misleading information about how to participate, misleading claims about requirements or officials involved in administering civic processes, and content that could suppress or intimidate participation. Several examples, such as claims about polling places being closed, police activity near voting sites, or disruptions at voting locations, remain present but are now integrated into streamlined categories rather than listed as isolated cases.

Enforcement has also been rewritten. Prior statements indicating that X would apply labels to violative posts and restrict their reach have been replaced with a model that highlights Community Notes as the platform’s primary transparency tool. The update introduces a dedicated “Civic Integrity label” reserved for critical escalations rather than routine moderation, and expands the list of possible enforcement outcomes into a more structured but less prescriptive sequence. The section describing appeals has been rewritten as well, now stating that authors “can appeal” rather than “are able to submit an appeal”.

Finally, a new “How to Report” section replaces the previous footer. It directs users to the reporting flow through the “Civic Integrity” option.

Overall, the revision broadens the policy’s scope, reduces specificity in prohibited examples, and reallocates enforcement toward a community-driven context rather than automatic labelling. This introduces more flexibility for X in interpreting violations while decreasing the level of detail previously available to users about how the rules would be applied.
