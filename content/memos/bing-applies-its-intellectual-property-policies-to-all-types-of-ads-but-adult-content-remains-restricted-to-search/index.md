On January 8, 2026, Bing [modified](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/8e63f32d84a6d01f3174e6ab200b2432b1cbf821) its *intellectual property policies* to apply to ‘all ad types’, instead of just ‘Search’. It also stated that ‘Adult is not allowed in other ad types’, which include ‘native’, ‘display’, and ‘video’. The updated [guidelines](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/ext60211) outline specific standards for ‘counterfeit policy’ and ‘trademark used in [the] text of the ad or keywords, as well as imagery contained in the creative’. The modification primarily streamlines the implementation of this policy across the various ad networks that Bing is operating.

However, the [adult content policy](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60367/-1) remains in place for search. The document specifies that adult advertisements are defined by the content of the ad copy and the target website. It also provides a list of countries that may be targeted.

Search ads appear in search results on sites that use Bing, such as DuckDuckGo and Ecosia.
This channel is not only limited to text, but also includes images. Search results being limited by the keywords used during interactions with the search engine makes them more reliable in terms of consent. On the contrary, other types of ads are prone to unsolicited displays of content. This partially solves the problem of displaying age-inappropriate content to young audiences. It also ensures that the search engine continues to serve as a conduit for web traffic through paid advertising.

The [adult content policy](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60367/-1) makes it mandatory for concerned ads to be mediated by an age-gating mechanism on the publisher’s responsibility.

Age verification is a controversial issue in many jurisdictions. The efficacy of shielding youth audiences, the practicality of implementing such measures, and the potential for perpetuating surveillance systems are all matters of concern.
