Pinterest [removed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/8d685ba4941f240bc76d0e7a6a78b901f4581a23) a number of specific website-quality rules for merchants, including requirements for a dedicated “About Us” page, domain age minimums, and prohibitions on pop-ups or forced registration to view products. These have been replaced with a simpler standard against poor editorial content, including broken links or incomplete pages.

Pinterest has also expanded eligibility for vehicle merchant catalogs to include Canada. It was previously limited to the United States and Germany.
