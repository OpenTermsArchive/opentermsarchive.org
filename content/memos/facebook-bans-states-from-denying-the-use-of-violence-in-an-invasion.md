Facebook <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/b315d25#diff-57f4f166af0a7f6e4fc8f63a103c74f5a8d47754238aad621db0eebdf4048df4R24">will no longer allow</a> "governments that have instituted sustained blocks of social media to use their official departments, agencies, and embassies to deny the use of force or violent events in the context of an attack against the territorial integrity of another state." Facebook adds that it may require additional information or context to ensure compliance with this new rule, as well as for other forms of manipulation already covered (astroturfing, government or foreign interference).

The only situation that currently fits this new provision is the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
