YouTube [removed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/1343610f78702cf24d071f623ab5eba02dad6d29#diff-9c397c37c7e78e06148eed3f044d003da8f001e9149d65f3a08bbfdca997d612L1988) colloidal silver from the list of harmful substances that are not allowed to be promoted on YouTube both as prevention and treatment methods. This change was reflected in the Medical Misinformation section of its Community Guidelines.

Colloidal silver consists of silver particles in liquid form, and is often [advocated](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/colloidal-silver) as a dietary supplement and an alternative medicine for treatment of various infections and diseases. There is however, no clear scientific evidence to support these claims. In 1999, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [warned](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2214158) that colloidal silver products are not recognised as safe and effective. There have also been [reports](https://www.wired.com/story/does-colloidal-silver-work/?_sp=d5ff2a97-5dc0-4534-acff-7e485950488b.1760138370827) on the severe side-effects of long-term colloidal silver ingestion, causing a skin discolouration condition called argyria. Medical practitioners have [condemned](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304662#:~:text=No%20scientific%20evidence%20has%20been%20found%20for,some%20parts%20of%20the%20world%2C%20including%20Finland.) internet platforms in the past for not adhering to regulatory bodies, and popularising the use of colloidal silver.
