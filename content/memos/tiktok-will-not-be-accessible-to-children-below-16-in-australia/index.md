TikTok [added](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-au-versions/commit/a0a6ba8e5aa366a0b4d914ac66077dcab2931c9e) minimum age requirements in compliance with the Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) law under the Online Safety Act 2021 in Australia. Under the terms for Australian residents, the platform specified that “TikTok is not directed at children under the age of 16”. The policy also includes links to report users below the age of 16, and to raise complaints and escalate to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) if needed. 

The Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) law came into effect on December 10, 2025, in Australia and has [garnered](https://globalvoices.org/2025/12/15/australias-under-16-social-media-ban-under-microscope-at-home-and-abroad/) criticism from teenagers, activists, and politicians. Reddit has also filed a lawsuit against the Australian government to oppose these requirements.
