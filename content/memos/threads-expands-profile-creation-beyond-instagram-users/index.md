Threads [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/5f308804ef652e4ae29de093eeadaa2ab34fcbbb) its Privacy Policy to now allow users to create a profile without an Instagram account. Previously, Threads profiles were only accessible to users with an Instagram account. With this update, it is possible to create a Threads profile using only an email address or phone number.

According to the change, Threads remains a service "provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited" that "is a part of Instagram." The update also specifies that "if you have created a Threads profile with your email address or phone number [Meta Platforms] wonâ€™t collect and use information from any Instagram accounts you might have" to personalize the Threads experience (including ads).

Threads is a social media service that can be browsed in part without a profile, but requires identification via a Threads profile to access the full set of features.
