Threads [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/5f308804ef652e4ae29de093eeadaa2ab34fcbbb) its Privacy Policy to remove the Instagram account requirement for new users. Users can now sign up directly with their email address or phone number, instead of needing an Instagram account as previously required.

According to the change, Threads remains a service "provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited" that "is a part of Instagram." The update also specifies that "if you have created a Threads profile with your email address or phone number [Meta Platforms] wonâ€™t collect and use information from any Instagram accounts you might have" to personalize the Threads experience (including ads).

Threads is a social media service that can be browsed in part without a profile, but requires identification via a Threads profile to access the full set of features.
