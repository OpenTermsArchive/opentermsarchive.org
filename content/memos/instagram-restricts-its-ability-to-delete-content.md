Until now, Instagram said it would remove information shared on its platform if it believed the content to violate its terms of use, or if the firm was permitted or required to do so by law. The document [now states](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/versions-france/commit/b8b71e45d56728242ce7c5da3e8b7ef790eec57a#diff-311682cd6d20df952901439aefad05738f09eb8ca4f505b3af21ce20ff70f23aR109) that Instagram will only remove content on behalf of the law of the country concerned if it is "required" to do so.
