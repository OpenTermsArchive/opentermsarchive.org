On January 4, 2026, AliExpress [modified][1] its Marketplace Sellers Conditions, allowing the sale of "living animals and plants" in certain countries. Since December 31st, ‘local sellers in Poland, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain can sell live plants if they meet the compliance requirements’. An announcement released on October 14, 2025, [stated][2] that "plant seeds, living plants only for ornamental purposes rather than food purposes". ‘Agricultural and vegetable’ products are still prohibited for sale.

AliExpress is a serious competitor for Amazon in the field of online shopping. The Chinese company has recently started delivering fresh food in [South Korea][3] and in [London][4][^1].

In November 2023, the European Union was already [investigating][5] AliExpress for distributing ‘illegal products such as fake medicines, non-compliant food, and ineffective dietary supplements’.
