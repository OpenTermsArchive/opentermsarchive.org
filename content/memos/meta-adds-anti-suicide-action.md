On June 13, Facebook [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/242048233610ece2729d0b39047dcd5adeb21e25) the target group of users receiving “help resources” to those who post “vague, potentially suicidal statements or references (including memes or photo library images about sad moods or depression) in the context of suicide or self-harm”. Meta [changed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/82cc72a102fc78107e7094f995e07b9e4364431d) the same elements on Instagram.

These modifications can be read in light of the recurring questioning of Facebook’s responsiveness to suicide cases. In 2019, the company had already [tightened](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2019/02/08/suicide-automutilation-instagram-et-facebook-vont-supprimer-les-contenus-explicites_5421003_4408996.html) the rules on its various networks after the suicide of a 14-year-old British teenager.
