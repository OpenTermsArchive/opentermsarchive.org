Doubao [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/ada4e457907c93f9073efddf755c27ab3ff7ac58) the scope of data collection to include "input information", explicitly encompassing dialogue content and search text. To further broaden the coverage of behavioral information, it appended "etc." at the conclusion of enumerating such data.

Doubao committed to making “every effort” to safeguard users' personal information and retaining it only “for the period necessary to provide Doubao services”. It also added the requirement that minors under the age of 14 must “obtain consent from their guardian” to use the service.

This data collection builds upon the initial behavioral data collection [introduced]({{<relref path="doubao-starts-tracking-users-behavioral-data">}}) three months earlier.
