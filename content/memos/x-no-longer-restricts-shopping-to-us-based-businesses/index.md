X [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/e74e82155f06490f2bb7e21b6c118ba335cd4acc) its rules regarding merchandise sales. It is no longer necessary to have a US-based business. It also allows state-affiliated media to sell merchandise. Selling merchandise was previously restricted to ‘Professional Account[s]’, but it’s now open to X Premium and X Premium accounts. Pricing can now be in local currency, not just in US dollars. The list of prohibited merchandise categories was extensively revised, but the scope of the policy remained unchanged.

Twitter is a social media platform whose main revenue is digital advertising. Since [the acquisition by Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Since_2022) in 2022, the service has been rebranded as X. In 1999, Elon Musk already co-founded an online bank named [X.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com_\(bank\)). It became PayPal after merging with Confinity, a bank cofounded by Peter Thiel. X.com was envisioned as a [super-app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-app) that would host an ecosystem of services, such as banking and shopping. [WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat) is the main example of a super-app in the Chinese digital ecosystem. Going beyond being an instant messaging service, WeChat allows users to purchase goods, book accommodation, and even hail a taxi.
