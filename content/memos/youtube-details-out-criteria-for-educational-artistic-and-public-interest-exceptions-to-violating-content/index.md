YouTube [expanded](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/c2052c3843124de40812bd065df9a842a62137f4) on its criteria for exceptions to content violating community guidelines. It clarified that in some cases, content with educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA) context including public interest content will be considered an exception to otherwise prohibited content. This was updated in several sections of the community guidelines including Nudity & Sexual Content Policy, Child Safety policy, Suicide, Self-Harm, and Eating Disorders policy, Harmful or Dangerous Content policy, Hate Speech policy, and Misinformation policies. 

While the EDSA exception was already stated in many of these sections, YouTube also added public interest content such as “congressional or parliamentary proceedings, campaign speeches, or debates over ongoing government actions” to the list of exceptions and age-restricted content.
