Midjourney [ceased](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/e2662337073ce704cbf2dd91457dc7d89ae59e36?diff=split&w=0) to refer to the entitlements of unpaid members to the assets they create. Indeed, Midjourney [stopped](https://help.midjourney.com/en/articles/8150088-is-there-a-free-trial) offering free trials. They also extended the obligation to subscribe for a Pro or Mega plan for employees of companies with over 1M$ in revenue.

Midjourney amended its community guidelines, prohibiting the use of their services for illegal activities. The guidelines explicitly prohibited misleading recipients regarding the nature and origin of the created images.
