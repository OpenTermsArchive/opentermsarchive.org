Instagram has [removed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/4a8e001c92a2b2a29bea609fc2b52fceef515b6c) the option for users to opt out of interest-based ads through their mobile device settings. Previously, the document mentioned that users could control their ad tracking preferences “using Android, iOS 13 or an earlier version of iOS.”
