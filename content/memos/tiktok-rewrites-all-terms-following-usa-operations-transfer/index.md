On January 23, 2026, TikTok [revised](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23) multiple policy documents in several jurisdictions. The updates established a new legal entity, _“TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC”_, as the new “operator of the Platform in the United States”. Most importantly, the terms that applied globally with a few paragraphs defining local specificities, now have a dedicated US version that applies only to that country.

The [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/ead840fe377f24345b833cdf770cde7e3cd398c3) privacy policy for this US entity (also applicable to TikTok Ad Network) replaced all references to the "Platform" with "Service". It now includes data collection from AI interactions. The [tracking](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/tiktok-expands-data-collection-in-europe-the-united-kingdom-and-switzerland/) of precise location information if location services for the TikTok app are enabled has been part of the policy in Europe, the United Kingdom and Switzerland since October 2025.

The data collection through usage information has also been expanded to include the duration and frequency of use of the Services, engagement with other users, and information about interactions with websites while using the in-app browser. It will collect further data through sellers as well as payment and transaction fulfillment providers, such as payment confirmation details, and information about the delivery of products purchased through TikTok's shopping features.

The Service has added shopping features and age verification as purposes for data collection, and widened information sharing with several new Service Providers and Business Partners such as TT Commerce & Global Services LLC and its affiliates to facilitate a global and interoperable experience, sellers and their service providers, and third-party platforms and partners. The policy states that the U.S. entity will share certain data with international TikTok operations for interoperability in compliance with applicable laws.

Documents from other jurisdictions ([Ireland](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ie-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23), the [United Kingdom](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-gb-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23), [Australia](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-au-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23) and [Canada](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ca-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23)) have been less affected. They mainly reflect changes in the service's contact points in the US and update links to point to new "global" versions of the terms that now differ from the US version. The Developer Terms, however, contain a new section named "[TikTok Developer US Data Sharing Agreement](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ca-versions/commit/567351ff16948889f8b500500d92b01be4d286f9#diff-d0b0f6dad4d26fa6e1f58d217b15bb5e2a85e1054afd15df9f7ca8632156a301R408)".

This establishment of a US-based entity for TikTok has come into place to address national security concerns and avoid a potential [ban](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tiktok-reaches-deal-new-us-joint-venture-avoid-american-ban-2026-01-23/). TikTok is the object of scrutiny regarding [digital rights](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-accuses-meta-tiktok-of-breaching-digital-rules/), [election integrity](https://www.techpolicy.press/tiktok-telegram-and-trust-urgent-lessons-from-romanias-election/), [misleading political information](https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-pro-north-korean-tiktoks-are-also-bizarre-ads-for-supplements/) and [direct influence over young audiences](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/11/04/paris-prosecutor-s-office-investigates-tiktok-over-content-promoting-suicide_6747109_7.html). But beyond these points, the United States of America have treated TikTok's case as a matter of national security, in a [long-standing conflict](https://restofworld.org/2026/tiktok-deal-oracle-china-us/) with China that culminated with Oracle [buying](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3edd1l328lo) TikTok's US operations, leading to these changes.
