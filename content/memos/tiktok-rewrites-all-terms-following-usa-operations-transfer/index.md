On January 23, 2026, TikTok [revised](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23) multiple policy documents in several jurisdictions. The updates established a new legal entity, _“TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC”_, as the new “operator of the Platform in the United States”. Most importantly, the terms that applied globally with a few paragraphs defining local specificities, now have a dedicated US version that applies only to that country.

Documents from other jurisdictions ([Ireland](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ie-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23), the [United Kingdom](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-gb-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23), [Australia](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-au-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23) and [Canada](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ca-versions/commits/main/TikTok?since=2026-01-23&until=2026-01-23)) have been less affected. They mainly reflect changes in the service’s contact points in the US and update links to point to new “global” versions of the terms that now differ from the US version. The Developer Terms, however, contain a new section named “[TikTok Developer US Data Sharing Agreement](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ca-versions/commit/567351ff16948889f8b500500d92b01be4d286f9#diff-d0b0f6dad4d26fa6e1f58d217b15bb5e2a85e1054afd15df9f7ca8632156a301R408)”.

TikTok is the object of scrutiny regarding [digital rights](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-accuses-meta-tiktok-of-breaching-digital-rules/), [election integrity](https://www.techpolicy.press/tiktok-telegram-and-trust-urgent-lessons-from-romanias-election/), [misleading political information](https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-pro-north-korean-tiktoks-are-also-bizarre-ads-for-supplements/) and [direct influence over young audiences](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/11/04/paris-prosecutor-s-office-investigates-tiktok-over-content-promoting-suicide_6747109_7.html). But beyond these points, the United States of America have treated TikTok’s case as a matter of national security, in a [long-standing conflict](https://restofworld.org/2026/tiktok-deal-oracle-china-us/) with China that culminated with Oracle [buying](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3edd1l328lo) TikTok’s US operations, leading to these changes.
