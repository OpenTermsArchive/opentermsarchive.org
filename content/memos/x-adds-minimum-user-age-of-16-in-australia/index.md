X [specified](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-au-versions/commit/a948db2063fa4e17f16988b999ca7b62452e599c) that users only above the age of 16 can use an X account in Australia. The update has been made in order to comply with the Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) requirements of the Online Safety Act 2021 under Australian law. The SMMA prohibits certain age-restricted social media platforms from letting people under the age of 16 create or hold an account. While outlining its age-verification approaches, X has listed using existing information such as self-attested age, ID verification, legacy verified public figures, account creation date, and verified government or organisational accounts. When these are unavailable, X will use email address-based estimation to verify the age. If these methods are unsuccessful, the platform will require users to submit a government-issued ID, which will be used to verify their age by artificial intelligence systems.  

X has also added terms to handle the information collected during the verification process. It will use ID details for age verification purposes only and destroy the data collected within 31 days. When an account holder is determined to be below 16 years of age, they will be unable to use an X account. Further, the policy details out mechanisms to appeal an age assurance decision and to report a suspected underage account. Similar to the previous version of the policy, accounts belonging to known minors between the ages of 16 and 18 years will be allowed ,with certain restrictions on visibility of posts and receiving direct messages. 

The Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) law came into effect on December 10, 2025, in Australia and has [garnered](https://globalvoices.org/2025/12/15/australias-under-16-social-media-ban-under-microscope-at-home-and-abroad/) criticism from teenagers, activists, and politicians. Reddit has also filed a lawsuit against the Australian government to oppose these requirements.
