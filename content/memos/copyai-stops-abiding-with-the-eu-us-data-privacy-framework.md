Copy.AI [erased](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/c8a3f106587decf0cb6b5e0ce7695929d153a856) from its privacy policy its commitment to abide by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.

Replacing the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework allows companies to self-certify their compliance with local European laws. Personal data transfers from these jurisdictions are then deemed “adequately protected” according to the adequacy decision of the Commission of July 2023.
