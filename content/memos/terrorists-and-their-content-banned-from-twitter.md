Twitter [made clear](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/4c973b7c1cfa724c3f922adb88be091957a676c1?diff=unified&short_path=97a74cf#diff-97a74cf182c32c5fd04a7f7ad157a172456b1e3ead0535083736fb3a8ce84c38) that it will delete "any accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks" and that it may delete all third-party content "disseminating manifestos or other content produced by the perpetrators".

The addition can be read in light of several terrorist attacks celebrated online by their perpetrators: the Christchurch attacks had been broadcast live on the networks, as well as the Baerum massacre and then the Halle attack. After the Charlottesville attack in the United States in 2017, Twitter had been accused of not properly controlling violent speech, especially from white supremacists, and then increased its means of combating such publications. In the first half of 2021, Twitter [says it has suspended](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/transparency-19) nearly 45,000 accounts for apology of terrorism.
