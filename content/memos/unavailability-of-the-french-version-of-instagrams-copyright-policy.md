Instagram seems to have trouble publishing its community rules on its French website since April 5. According to tests conducted by Open Terms Archive, some parts of the text are completely unavailable in French (the ["What happens when I submit a copyright report to Instagram ?"](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/00799bfa25dd930aa68af8dbbfa8ed59cda35b5f) page only shows an English version), or only partially translated (in the ["copyright" page](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/21eae014249e946abdc9eb3609b2e3f7c3ac181d), the introduction and titles are in English, the rest of the text is in French)
