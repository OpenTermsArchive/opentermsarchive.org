YouTube <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/31605bd7408cdfe8c6362aa81ffa1d65a81dc2d8#diff-9c397c37c7e78e06148eed3f044d003da8f001e9149d65f3a08bbfdca997d612L103">changed</a> the presentation of its YouTube Trusted Flagger program, which offers more direct access to the platform to remove posts that violate its rules. It was until then intended for some NGOs, government agencies and users who effectively report content that violates the rules. It is now presented as open only to non-governmental organizations and public authorities.
