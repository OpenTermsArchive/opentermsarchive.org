  step1:
    title: 1. Targeting
    subtitle: The terms of use of a service are targeted by contributors.
    exemple: |
      {
        "name": "Facebook",
        "documents": {
          "Terms of Service": {
            "fetch": "https://facebook.com/legal/terms",
            "select": "body > article > .main_content"
          },
          "Privacy Policy": {
            "fetch": "https://facebook.com/privacy",
            "select": "div > .fb_content"
          }
        }
      }
