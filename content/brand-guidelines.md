## Copywriting

### Common to all languages

- The name of the product is “Open Terms Archive”.
- Open Terms Archive is a brand name, not a common noun. It does not have a determiner.
- It is singular. It is not “Open Terms Archives”.
- It has spaces. It is not “OpenTermsArchive”.
- As often as possible, non-breakable spaces should be used to separate the three words, in order to avoid line breaks in the middle of the name.
- While the “OTA” abbreviation can be used in internal documents and discussions, it is not used publicly (at least not by us).

### For Example

You should **not write**:

```error
OTA enables activists to identify misleading terms.
The Open Terms Archive enables activists to identify misleading terms.
OpenTermsArchive enables activists to identify misleading terms.
```

You should **write**:

```success
Open Terms Archive enables activists to identify misleading terms.
```
