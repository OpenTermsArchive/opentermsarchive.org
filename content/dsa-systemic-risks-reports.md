# DSA Systemic Risks Reports Archive

### This archive ensures the long term preservation of DSA-mandated systemic risks reports. It supports research and reinforces platform accountability.

## Context

The European [Digital Services Act article 34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065/oj/eng#art_34) mandates very large online platforms and search engines (VLOPSEs) to publish systemic risk assessments “at least once every year”. [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org/) makes these reports available independently from platforms hosting, distributes them with a cryptographic audit trail guaranteeing that the data is not tampered with, and automatically tracks any changes applied to the reports after they are published.

## Data

| Platform | Year | Source document | Text version |
|----------|------|-----------------|--------------|

All documents can also be downloaded as an [Open Terms Archive dataset of DSA reports](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/dsa-reports-versions/releases).
