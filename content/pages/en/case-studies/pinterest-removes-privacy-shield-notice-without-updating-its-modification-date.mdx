# Pinterest removes Privacy Shield notice without updating its modification date

Pinterest has <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ambanum/CGUs-data/commit/a53e891ba">removed</a> a lengthy explanation of its data processing arrangements, which it said it was carrying out under the Privacy Shield then in place between the European Union and the United States. Until then, the company was committed to resolving any complaints about personal data processing and verifying as much as possible that its partners were also in compliance with the Privacy Shield. On July 21, 2020, this part was replaced by a simple sentence stating that personal data from the European Economic Area could be processed outside of it, without a commitment to manage complaints. The platform did not indicate in its "summary of recent changes" at the top of the document that it had made any such changes.
