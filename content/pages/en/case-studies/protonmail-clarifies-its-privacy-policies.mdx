On September 6, 2021, ProtonMail <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/510c7d65e4254e1d53221b139d7e25bb2b990510">amended</a> its privacy policies so as to clarify the effects of Swiss laws (where the company is based) on the handling of user data. So, while the company claims to offer a particularly secure email service, it may find itself "forced to share the IP address" of its users with law enforcement in criminal investigations.

The day before the change, the website <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://paris-luttes.info/recit-policier-de-sainte-marthe-15258?lang=fr">Paris-Luttes.info</a> and various <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/OnEstLaTech/status/1434576598418796549">Internet users</a> revealed that ProtonMail had communicated the IP addresses of users linked to the Youth for Climate group to the Swiss justice system. These addresses had been requested by the French police <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/736940-protonmail-transmet-des-adresses-ip-a-la-police-4-questions-pour-comprendre-la-polemique.html">via Europol</a>. This change mirrors what the company had indicated on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/pil6xi/climate_activist_arrested_after_protonmail/hbqha63">Reddit</a>.
