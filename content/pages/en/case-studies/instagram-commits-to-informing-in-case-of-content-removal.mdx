Some progress: Instagram now [announces](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/versions-france/commit/b8b71e45d56728242ce7c5da3e8b7ef790eec57a?short_path=311682c#) that in some cases where it removes content, the firm will notify the user and explain their options for requesting a review. Such a decision could have an impact on accounts like those of the 14 French feminist influencers who [took the social network to court](https://www.neonmag.fr/censure-14-feministes-assignent-instagram-en-justice-on-ne-peut-plus-subir-ce-deux-poids-deux-mesures-573103.html) last year. They accused Instagram of deleting posts or accounts without giving clear explanations of the reasons for these deletions, or tools to defend themselves.  The terms of use do not, however, specify the cases in which Instagram will provide the announced information. They also warn that no information will be given if the user gravely or repeatedly violates the terms, among other situations that Meta will consider particularly serious.
