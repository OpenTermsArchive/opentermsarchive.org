  # Open Terms Archive is free and open source software aiming at becoming a digital common.

  This means its source code can be freely reused and built upon, as long as improvements are made available to the community under the same conditions. This also means that decisions on the evolution of the product will be taken in an increasingly democratic manner as the community that builds it will grow. Its <Link href="/budget">budget</Link> and <Link href="/stats">ecosystem metrics</Link> are public and transparent.

  **We are looking for funding to expand usage and ensure the sustainability of Open Terms Archive. Do you know of ways to help? Please [contact us](mailto:contact@opentermsarchive.org)!**
