### Achievements

- In the second quarter of 2022, Open Terms Archive was [used](https://www.reset.tech/resources/memos-on-platforms-behaviour-during-the-2022-french-elections/) during the French presidential elections by Reset.tech to update disinformation researchers within 48 hours of any change in the terms and guidelines related to the topic in the 5 largest social media platforms used in France. We could for example [inform them](https://opentermsarchive.org/case-studies/youtube-closes-its-fast-track-content-flagging-program-to-individuals) ahead of time of the removal of the YouTube Trusted Flagger program, which enabled individuals to flag harmful content.
