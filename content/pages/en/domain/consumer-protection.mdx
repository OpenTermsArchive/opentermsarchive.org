### Achievements

- In the first quarter of 2022, France's largest consumer protection association, [UFC-Que Choisir](https://www.quechoisir.org), detected several irregularities in French online marketplaces thanks to Open Terms Archive tracking. They requested and obtained the [correction](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-versions/commit/0184178ee2fffbd5283c50f114e3211667391b15) of several non-functional links to cooling-off cancellation forms.
- In January 2022, Open Terms Archive was used as an example of feasibility in the [TLDR Act](https://trahan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2353), a bill presented to the US Congress aiming at forcing platforms to clarify their commitments towards end users.
