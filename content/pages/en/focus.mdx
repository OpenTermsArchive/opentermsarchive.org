title: How Open Terms Archive makes a difference
---

### Open Terms Archive addresses a critical gap in the ability of regulators, lawmakers, researchers, journalists and activists to understand, respond to, and influence the rules of online services.

Digital platforms hold immense power in forming global information flows, managing personal data and dictating business practices, and thus massively influence societal change. Their power is shaped by the rules set forth in complex and regularly changing documents that define how these platforms operate: terms of service, privacy policies, community guidelines…

These terms often offer unequal rights and opportunities across jurisdictions and increasingly constitute norms designed unilaterally, with little to no democratic oversight. Due to the sheer volume of these documents, the frequency at which they change, and the legalese often used, these critical governing rules remain largely opaque, even to the most dedicated observers.

Open Terms Archive publicly records these terms in different languages and countries several times a day, increasing their readability and highlighting their changes.

Beyond immediate practical usage as a repository of historical terms of service, Open Terms Archive is designed as a tool to steer platform governance towards increased accountability, improved legislation and stronger regulatory compliance.  It makes it clear to every service provider that their actions are seen and recorded. It draws the attention of the public on how it gets treated and which actions were effective in changing that. It gathers an ecosystem of powerful counter-powers around shared datasets.


### Unite to influence

Open Terms Archive aims at gathering the forces that are able to push platforms to adopt more loyal behaviour:

- Regulatory bodies: competition authorities possess the capacity to impose multi-billion-dollar fines and can even prohibit market operations. Similarly, data protection authorities in the European Union can enforce penalties relative to an entity's global revenue under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- Legislative authorities: the architects of legislative frameworks like the GDPR, CCPA, and DSA wield substantial influence over business operations within their respective jurisdictions. Notably, the jurisdiction of the EU and USA extends beyond their geographical borders.
- Media and press: journalistic reporting on platform behavior can significantly impact a service's reputation, potentially threatening their user base.
- Consumer protection associations: by initiating complaints on behalf of users, these organizations can establish legal precedents that deter platforms from indulging in unfair practices. For example, the Schrems I and Schrems II rulings dismantled the legal infrastructure allowing mass transfers of EU citizens' personal data to the USA, where more lax data protection measures have enabled scandals such as Cambridge Analytica’s.

Open Terms Archive is designed to amplify the capabilities of these influential entities, fostering greater platform integrity and mitigating the exploitation of their vulnerabilities by malign actors. It achieves this by facilitating recognition of positive platform changes, improving precision and reactiveness to negative changes, supporting large-scale analysis of regulatory impact, and enabling targeted legislative drafting
