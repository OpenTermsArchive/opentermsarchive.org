When you visit this website, we leave a small text file (a “cookie”) on your computer. This allows us to measure how many visits we’ve had and which pages are most viewed.

## Why doesn’t this website show a consent banner for cookies?

The tracking software we use, Matomo, is open-source, self-managed, and set up to properly anonymize your data and is thus exempt from prior consent according to the French data protection authority CNIL’s recommendations.

## I contribute to your data, can I access it?

Of course! The analytics data for this website are publicly available on [stats.data.gouv.fr](https://stats.data.gouv.fr/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=179&period=range&date=previous30&updated=1#?idSite=179&period=range&date=previous30&segment=&category=Dashboard_Dashboard&subcategory=1)
