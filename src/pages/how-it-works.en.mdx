## 1. Service statement and document

To add a document tracking you can use <Link href="/contribute">the add document interface</Link> on this website. It is a simple interface that allows you to make a request to add a document to be tracked in a few clicks.

For those comfortable with GitHub, you can submit a pull request to the [OpenTermsArchive](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive) GitHub repository by declaring a new <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> file containing the service and document information to be tracked in the `services` folder.

**Regardless of the method you are considering, [the full documentation](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) about the contribution may be useful to you.**

The list of services and documents tracked is [available here](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive/tree/master/services).

## 2. Recording raw data

To keep track of document changes, the Open Term Archive downloads them at regular intervals from their URLs. **Each version of the downloaded documents** (called `snapshot`)** is saved in a Git repository** accessible here: [OpenTermsArchive-Snapshots](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive-snapshots).

This repository can be considered as a database. It is distributed under the [ODC-BY 1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/) license, which means that you are free to share (copy, distribute and use), adapt (modify, transform and exploit) it as long as you attribute it to the French Ambassador's Office for Digital Affairs.

## 3. Recording significant data

Uploaded web pages may contain navigation elements (main menu, breadcrumb trail, footer links...), advertisements, a search field... These are elements of the page which are not significant, called "noise", i.e. they do not directly concern the content which is interesting. \*\*The Open Terms Archive stores a version of this document in which the noise is removed.

To do this, in the [service declaration](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tracking-new-documents), the `select` property allows you to target a <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> node on the page and the `remove` property allows you to remove it. There is also a [filter mechanism](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#filter) (in Javascript), which allows for more complex documents, to do operations on the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> before saving it.

The data is available in the GitHub repository [OpenTermsArchive-versions](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive-versions) and they too are distributed under the [ODC-BY 1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/) license.

## 4. Browsing the version history

It is possible to browse the version history through the GitHub interface of the [OpenTermsArchive-versions](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive-versions/) repository. To do this, click on the service folder of your choice and then on the document type. You will be able to see all the versions by clicking on the "History" link.

You can also use [Scripta Manent](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/fr/open-terms-archive/scripta-manent), a simple tool built on the Open Terms Archive that allows you to measure changes between two dates of your choice.

## 5. Being notified

Anyone wishing to track document changes can choose to be notified by email.

Be careful, however, as this service is in beta version and you may receive many notifications! It is still possible to unsubscribe by replying to any email received. Each user can also be informed of changes to a contractual document by subscribing to the RSS feed for a specific page.

For more information, [read this](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive#be-notified).
