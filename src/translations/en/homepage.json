  "how.desc.p2": "In order to track their changes, documents are periodically obtained by fetching a web location and selecting content within the web page to remove the noise (ads, navigation menu, login fields‚Ä¶). Beyond selecting a subset of a page, some documents have additional noise (hashes in links, CSRF tokens‚Ä¶) that would be false for changes. Open Terms Archive thus supports specific filters for each document.",

In order to recover in case of information loss during the noise filtering step, a snapshot is recorded every there is a change.
