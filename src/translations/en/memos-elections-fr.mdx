Major elections are often an opportunity for major social media services to update their terms of use. Indeed, civil society and regulators have stronger scrutiny on their reactivity to close some of their vulnerabilities to the latest forms of information manipulation.

In its goal to stop Big Tech companies from profiting off public harm, [Reset](https://reset.tech) was interested in equipping its network of partners with tools to monitor electoral interference and ways to counter it. The 2022 French presidential and parliamentary elections sequence provided an opportunity to leverage Open Terms Archive to that aim.

Thanks to Reset funding, a [dedicated Open Terms Archive instance](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-declarations) was set up to track documents for the 5 most used social media in France that could have a systemic impact on the elections. [Features](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive/issues/773) were added to the engine to track the dozens of documents that make the platforms “Community Guidelines”. And a human analysis of important changes over email was published in two languages.

### Memos

These “Memos”, short analyses published within 48 hours of the detection of changes, are publicly available below.

### Benefits

This enabled Reset and its network to:

- **Detect changes in behaviours of platforms**, both [explorable interactively](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions) and in the form of a [dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/releases) enabling research.
- **Stay up-to-date on the means for requesting removal of harmful content**. We could for example observe this in the weeks preceding the USA presidential election, with [changes](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/98f6c#diff-0acb220b6571d7068bbce1b07e4f950300d319ccfde7f19f790b6654b0d9b978R586) to the Google Play Store policies directly closing some vulnerabilities to information manipulation, such as removing apps with “functionality to alter media clips to mimic a news broadcast, and add famous or public figures to the clip without a watermark” or that “features medical or health-related claims that is misleading”.
- On the longer term, **measure the response to regulatory changes and reputational pressure**. We could for example observe the impact of the Schrems II ruling (repeal of the Privacy Shield EU/US personal data transfer agreement) on Privacy Policies of several [large actors](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/27beddd06), and accumulating such data before the implementation of the [DSA](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/policies/digital-services-act-package) will enable academic research on its impact.
