## You are now a contributor to the Open Terms Archive project

To manage the contributions easily, we use GitHub issues. So we created one that <a href={url} target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can see here</a>. This allows you to know the status of your contribution and to communicate with us about it.

We do our best to add your request as fast possible as possible but it may take several days. Indeed, to guarantee a high quality of data we test each contribution to make sure that everything works perfectly.

If you would like to be added to the list of contributors posted on the OTA website, simply send us an <a href="mailto:contact@opentermsarchive.org">email</a> or a direct message on our <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenTerms" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> account.
