Starting on 22 May 2024, the additional terms “no longer apply, unless you’re a business partner with a signed agreement that references these terms.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This move is emblematic of the broader industry trend that considers Generative AI as a generic component of provided tools and services, as opposed to a separate set of services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Instagram adds a posting ban to protect copyright</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</guid><description>&lt;p>On March 28, Instagram &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/1be4b836e3012344558b60d8f9f871bc42cfa4ca?short_path=c108c01#diff-c108c013f0b8769389f20259465cb81324e805f4334bcda6931344e16f999441">updated&lt;/a> its intellectual property community rules, prohibiting the posting of content that “facilitates copyright infringement through unauthorized devices or services.” The text presents a list of cases in which users would risk infringing the copyright of a third party or even merely “facilitating” such infringement, even if they did not intend to do so. After the previously listed cases, which include “you purchased or downloaded the content” or “you saw others post the same content,” Instagram adds that users risk infringing copyright if they “use an unauthorized streaming device or service (examples: a ‘jailbroken’ or ‘loaded’ app or service).”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Instagram blocks data retrieval and clarifies what information it retrieves</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</guid><description>&lt;p>In November 2021, Instagram made several updates to its &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/9998cb21b69a222540491a81dd05be19a9785891">community rules&lt;/a>, its &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/9aaf5dbfc3b34d45d640b0c7f96dce3598c7bcd2">terms of use&lt;/a> and its &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/927ceba3865d79cd1b123d9f4b9928b8e997070c">privacy policy&lt;/a>. Among the notable developments, the platform explicitly prohibits the sale or exchange of &amp;ldquo;non-medical or pharmaceutical substances.&amp;rdquo; It says it will remove all posts promoting such products, either for sale or to indicate personal consumption, except in a healing context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In its updated terms of service, Instagram prohibits creating accounts or using them in such a way as to retrieve information without permission, especially in an automated way. This could have an effect on the work of researchers like those of the NGO Algorithm Watch, a research project of which having already been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook/">closed by Instagram&lt;/a> in the summer of 2021. The platform also prohibits disseminating other users’ personal information.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Instagram commits to informing in case of content removal</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some progress: Instagram now &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/versions-france/commit/b8b71e45d56728242ce7c5da3e8b7ef790eec57a?short_path=311682c">announces&lt;/a> that in some cases where it removes content, the firm will notify the user and explain their options for requesting a review. Such a decision could have an impact on accounts like those of the 14 French feminist influencers who &lt;a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/high-tech/instagram/instagram-14-feministes-assignent-facebook-en-justice-apres-la-censure-de-leurs-contenus-7181707">took the social network to court&lt;/a> last year. They accused Instagram of deleting posts or accounts without giving clear explanations of the reasons for these deletions, or tools to defend themselves. The terms of use do not, however, specify the cases in which Instagram will provide the announced information. They also warn that no information will be given if the user gravely or repeatedly violates the terms, among other situations that Meta will consider particularly serious.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Instagram cross-references its data with user experience surveys</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-cross-references-its-data-with-user-experience-surveys/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-cross-references-its-data-with-user-experience-surveys/</guid><description>&lt;p>Instagram goes into &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/versions-france/commit/b8b71e45d56728242ce7c5da3e8b7ef790eec57a#diff-311682cd6d20df952901439aefad05738f09eb8ca4f505b3af21ce20ff70f23aR37">more detail&lt;/a> about its use of user data.

Meta &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/82cc72a102fc78107e7094f995e07b9e4364431d">changed&lt;/a> the same elements on Instagram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These modifications can be read in light of the recurring questioning of Facebook’s responsiveness to suicide cases. In 2019, the company had already &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2019/02/08/suicide-automutilation-instagram-et-facebook-vont-supprimer-les-contenus-explicites_5421003_4408996.html">tightened&lt;/a> the rules on its various networks after the suicide of a 14-year-old British teenager.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta allows more nudity in a medical context</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-allows-more-nudity-in-a-medical-context/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-allows-more-nudity-in-a-medical-context/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since June 13, Facebook &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/200fae809ed553d6882bef3659b4544fac37e322#diff-f5b2499012804c371ee8d35d8a109e0b7a91f6a2d6d7736ab9857bfd331dbf68R23-R26">specifies&lt;/a> that posts with visible genitals or stimulated female nipples are acceptable if the post is about a medical or health-related issue. Meta changed the same elements in the Instagram community rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This may be a further reaction to criticism of the moderation logic of the company&amp;rsquo;s platforms, which more easily allow male nipples to be shown than female ones. This has led to recurring removal of breast cancer prevention campaigns (as in &lt;a href="https://www.lequotidiendumedecin.fr/actus-medicales/sante-publique/ces-seins-que-facebook-ne-saurait-voir">2014&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/le-monde/article/2016/10/12/mammographie-et-facebook-du-choix-d-image-et-de-ses-consequences_5995671_4586753.html">2016&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.lepoint.fr/high-tech-internet/facebook-une-moderation-a-geometrie-variable-21-07-2018-2238056_47.php">2018&lt;/a>, and even &lt;a href="https://www.blogdumoderateur.com/facebook-conseil-surveillance-moderation-contenus-litigieux/">2021&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta expands reach against child exploitation</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-expands-reach-against-child-exploitation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-expands-reach-against-child-exploitation/</guid><description>&lt;p>The section on child exploitation for both Facebook and Instagram &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/0396436542fa7ef8dd8ae4dd02ff0ed5500e08a2">expanded&lt;/a> to cover not only publications that exploit minors, but also “any activity” related to such acts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This opens up the question of moderation of private discussions, as social platforms show difficulties in managing content related to child abuse —as recently as late March, the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/business/meta-child-sexual-abuse.html">showed&lt;/a> that moderation remains very light in this area, even though platforms are supposed to list this type of content and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23005576/facebook-content-moderators-child-sexual-abuse-material-csam-policy">report it&lt;/a> to authorities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta removes many hate speech protections</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-dampens-hate-speech-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-dampens-hate-speech-policy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Meta &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/a90e9d276cda1ca23878fd2b2df7cc066d549c20">rewrote&lt;/a> the “hate speech” section of its Community Guidelines, significantly broadening the content allowed on its platforms Facebook, Instagram and Threads. The rewritten section is now called “hateful conduct” and removes the statement that hate speech “creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion”. It also removes every mention to “offline violence” that could result from online hate speech.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of all, this rewrite adds some clear permissions:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation&lt;/strong>, given political and religious discourse about &lt;em>transgenderism&lt;/em>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and homosexuality (&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/a90e9d276cda1ca23878fd2b2df7cc066d549c20#diff-dd1aecfa753374588d9e40f891e39f556b365ad800c9713ef398255bc906aad0R1346">line 1346&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We do allow content arguing for gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs (&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/a90e9d276cda1ca23878fd2b2df7cc066d549c20#diff-dd1aecfa753374588d9e40f891e39f556b365ad800c9713ef398255bc906aad0R1340">line 1340&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using “sex- or gender-exclusive language when people […] &lt;strong>call for exclusion or use insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality. […] Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech.&lt;/strong>” (&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/a90e9d276cda1ca23878fd2b2df7cc066d549c20#diff-dd1aecfa753374588d9e40f891e39f556b365ad800c9713ef398255bc906aad0R1297">line 1297&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Beyond these additions, another revealing change is the removal of bans on specific forms of hate speech.

&lt;p>According to the change, Threads remains a service &amp;ldquo;provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;is a part of Instagram.&amp;rdquo; The update also specifies that &amp;ldquo;if you have created a Threads profile with your email address or phone number [Meta Platforms] won’t collect and use information from any Instagram accounts you might have&amp;rdquo; to personalize the Threads experience (including ads).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twitter adds a tool to report spam and impersonation</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-a-tool-to-report-spam-and-impersonation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-a-tool-to-report-spam-and-impersonation/</guid><description>&lt;p>To report tweets that are considered spam or impersonation, users previously had to go to the tweet and then use the &amp;ldquo;report tweet&amp;rdquo; feature. &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/056ada5513abfade20cd73458e56e41abe2f80cf?short_path=3089779#diff-3089779674bfd306d704d6da138bf9e166d07e8145f5bb30e7998f2fcdf9cdcf">Now&lt;/a> they can use &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/fr/forms/authenticity/impersonation">a form&lt;/a> without having to have a Twitter account.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twitter adds form and statement of jurisdictional consent to its copyright claims process</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</guid><description>&lt;p>On April 13, Twitter added a new condition to the issuance of a notice of dispute: it now requests the signature of a declaration of jurisdictional consent, which varies slightly depending on whether the user resides in the USA or not. For a French resident, it will therefore be necessary to attach to their information the statement of jurisdictional consent: &amp;ldquo;I consent to the jurisdiction of any court in which Twitter may be located.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twitter bans duplicated tweets</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-bans-duplicated-tweets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-bans-duplicated-tweets/</guid><description>&lt;p>Twitter &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/0bf0a8f85460f936781141bfaf764183867d0685">added&lt;/a> a ban on &amp;ldquo;Tweeting an existing phrase or content in a duplicative manner, whether individually or in concert with other accounts&amp;rdquo;. The change was added as Twitter updated a longer explanation of its reinforced fight against &amp;ldquo;copypastas&amp;rdquo;, both in the &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/copypasta-duplicate-content">English&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/fr/rules-and-policies/copypasta-duplicate-content">French&lt;/a> versions of its Platform integrity and authenticity rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a rule should help limit astroturfing practices such as those &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2022/video/2022/02/02/comment-des-militants-d-eric-zemmour-gonflent-artificiellement-la-presence-du-candidat-sur-twitter_6112033_6059010.html">used by Eric Zemmour&amp;rsquo;s teams&lt;/a> during the French presidential election.
