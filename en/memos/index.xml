Replacing the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework allows companies to self-certify their compliance with local European laws. Personal data transfers from these jurisdictions are then deemed “adequately protected” according to the adequacy decision of the Commission of July 2023.</description></item><item><title>Doubao expands behavioral data collection and establishes minimum age</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/doubao-expands-behavioral-data-collection-and-establishes-minimum-age/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/doubao-expands-behavioral-data-collection-and-establishes-minimum-age/</guid><description>Doubao expanded the scope of data collection to include &amp;ldquo;input information&amp;rdquo;, explicitly encompassing dialogue content and search text. To further broaden the coverage of behavioral information, it appended &amp;ldquo;etc.&amp;rdquo; at the conclusion of enumerating such data.
Doubao committed to making “every effort” to safeguard users&amp;rsquo; personal information and retaining it only “for the period necessary to provide Doubao services”.

Starting on 22 May 2024, the additional terms “no longer apply, unless you’re a business partner with a signed agreement that references these terms.”
This move is emblematic of the broader industry trend that considers Generative AI as a generic component of provided tools and services, as opposed to a separate set of services.</description></item><item><title>Instagram adds a posting ban to protect copyright</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</guid><description>On March 28, Instagram updated its intellectual property community rules, prohibiting the posting of content that “facilitates copyright infringement through unauthorized devices or services.” The text presents a list of cases in which users would risk infringing the copyright of a third party or even merely “facilitating” such infringement, even if they did not intend to do so. After the previously listed cases, which include “you purchased or downloaded the content” or “you saw others post the same content,” Instagram adds that users risk infringing copyright if they “use an unauthorized streaming device or service (examples: a ‘jailbroken’ or ‘loaded’ app or service).</description></item><item><title>Instagram blocks data retrieval and clarifies what information it retrieves</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</guid><description>In November 2021, Instagram made several updates to its community rules, its terms of use and its privacy policy. Among the notable developments, the platform explicitly prohibits the sale or exchange of &amp;ldquo;non-medical or pharmaceutical substances.&amp;rdquo; It says it will remove all posts promoting such products, either for sale or to indicate personal consumption, except in a healing context.
In its updated terms of service, Instagram prohibits creating accounts or using them in such a way as to retrieve information without permission, especially in an automated way.</description></item><item><title>Instagram commits to informing in case of content removal</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</guid><description>Some progress: Instagram now announces that in some cases where it removes content, the firm will notify the user and explain their options for requesting a review. Such a decision could have an impact on accounts like those of the 14 French feminist influencers who took the social network to court last year. They accused Instagram of deleting posts or accounts without giving clear explanations of the reasons for these deletions, or tools to defend themselves.</description></item><item><title>Instagram cross-references its data with user experience surveys</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-cross-references-its-data-with-user-experience-surveys/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-cross-references-its-data-with-user-experience-surveys/</guid><description>Instagram goes into more detail about its use of user data.

The document now states that Instagram will only remove content on behalf of the law of the country concerned if it is &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; to do so.</description></item><item><title>Instagram takes significantly more responsibility in case of an incident</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-takes-significantly-more-responsibility-in-case-of-an-incident/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-takes-significantly-more-responsibility-in-case-of-an-incident/</guid><description>In the previous version of its Terms of Services, the social network stated that it provided its service as it is, unable to guarantee its ideal and safe operation at all times. Instagram disclaimed (in all caps) any express or implied warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and stated that it did not control the words and publications of third parties, nor those of the user, and that its liability was limited to the extent permitted by law in the event of an incident.</description></item><item><title>LinkedIn's community rules are not translated anymore</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedins-community-rules-are-not-translated-anymore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedins-community-rules-are-not-translated-anymore/</guid><description>Since May 20, Open Terms Archive notes that LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s Community rules are no longer accessible in French —or any other language.

Meta changed the same elements on Instagram.
These modifications can be read in light of the recurring questioning of Facebook’s responsiveness to suicide cases. In 2019, the company had already tightened the rules on its various networks after the suicide of a 14-year-old British teenager.</description></item><item><title>Meta allows more nudity in a medical context</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-allows-more-nudity-in-a-medical-context/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-allows-more-nudity-in-a-medical-context/</guid><description>Since June 13, Facebook specifies that posts with visible genitals or stimulated female nipples are acceptable if the post is about a medical or health-related issue. Meta changed the same elements in the Instagram community rules.
This may be a further reaction to criticism of the moderation logic of the company&amp;rsquo;s platforms, which more easily allow male nipples to be shown than female ones. This has led to recurring removal of breast cancer prevention campaigns (as in 2014, 2016, 2018, and even 2021).</description></item><item><title>Meta expands reach against child exploitation</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-expands-reach-against-child-exploitation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-expands-reach-against-child-exploitation/</guid><description>The section on child exploitation for both Facebook and Instagram expanded to cover not only publications that exploit minors, but also “any activity” related to such acts.
This opens up the question of moderation of private discussions, as social platforms show difficulties in managing content related to child abuse —as recently as late March, the New York Times showed that moderation remains very light in this area, even though platforms are supposed to list this type of content and report it to authorities.</description></item><item><title>Meta tests notification of changes for its terms</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-tests-notification-of-changes-for-its-terms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-tests-notification-of-changes-for-its-terms/</guid><description>Meta has been busy lately: the company first added a notice on May 17 announcing that it would change its Terms of Services on July 26. However, the link that was supposed to show the upcoming changes did not work. On May 25, the mention disappeared. The day after, a new sentence appeared in both Instagram and Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Privacy policies, stating “We have updated our policy.” On Facebook, the link leads to a page mentioning an effect date of July 27, 2022.</description></item><item><title>Midjourney ceases free trials as it unveils subscription plans</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/midjourney-ceases-free-trials-as-it-unveils-subscription-plans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/midjourney-ceases-free-trials-as-it-unveils-subscription-plans/</guid><description>Midjourney ceased to refer to the entitlements of unpaid members to the assets they create. Indeed, Midjourney stopped offering free trials. They also extended the obligation to subscribe for a Pro or Mega plan for employees of companies with over 1M$ in revenue.
Midjourney amended its community guidelines, prohibiting the use of their services for illegal activities.

Incidentally, Murf ceased to disclose personal data to chat services by Crisp IM and to “affiliate partnership solution by LinkMink”.
Replacing the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework approved by the adequacy decision of the European Commission allows companies to safely transfer personal data from the EU to US, without having to put in place additional data protection safeguards.</description></item><item><title>Murf streamlines licensing through identified use cases</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/murf-streamlines-licensing-through-identified-use-cases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/murf-streamlines-licensing-through-identified-use-cases/</guid><description>First, Murf ceased to grant a license for the use and display of their logo/marks only to identify that the Generated Content originates from Murf.
Additionally, they stopped committing to presenting usage costs in their user interface.
Finally, Murf eliminated the requirement for API-users to seek approval from Murf for their descriptions of future API uses. Instead, Murf referenced a &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; process for the submitted descriptions of API usage by users.</description></item><item><title>New Microsoft tracker at TikTok</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/new-microsoft-tracker-at-tik-tok/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/new-microsoft-tracker-at-tik-tok/</guid><description>TikTok&amp;rsquo;s cookie policy has quietly evolved, with the social media company adding Bing Pixel to its analytics and marketing data providers.

In November 13 2023, they implemented tailored terms for European and business users, added new functionalities, imposed use restrictions, limited liability, and established appeals mechanisms. These changes were supposed to be effective on December 14 2023.
This delay could be related to the delays in adopting the EU AI Act, which is not to happen before 2024.</description></item><item><title>OpenAI enables transfer of control of non-European accounts to their employer</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/openai-enables-transfer-of-control-of-non-european-accounts-to-their-employer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/openai-enables-transfer-of-control-of-non-european-accounts-to-their-employer/</guid><description>OpenAI stated that starting on December 14, 2023, they would notify organisations (e.g. employers) about individual accounts created with organisational email addresses.

Now they can use a form without having to have a Twitter account.</description></item><item><title>Twitter adds form and statement of jurisdictional consent to its copyright claims process</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</guid><description>On April 13, Twitter added a new condition to the issuance of a notice of dispute: it now requests the signature of a declaration of jurisdictional consent, which varies slightly depending on whether the user resides in the USA or not. For a French resident, it will therefore be necessary to attach to their information the statement of jurisdictional consent: &amp;ldquo;I consent to the jurisdiction of any court in which Twitter may be located.</description></item><item><title>Twitter bans duplicated tweets</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-bans-duplicated-tweets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-bans-duplicated-tweets/</guid><description>Twitter added a ban on &amp;ldquo;Tweeting an existing phrase or content in a duplicative manner, whether individually or in concert with other accounts&amp;rdquo;. The change was added as Twitter updated a longer explanation of its reinforced fight against &amp;ldquo;copypastas&amp;rdquo;, both in the English and the French versions of its Platform integrity and authenticity rules.
Such a rule should help limit astroturfing practices such as those used by Eric Zemmour&amp;rsquo;s teams during the French presidential election.</description></item><item><title>Twitter bans publishing about prisoners of war</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-bans-publishing-about-prisoners-of-war/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-bans-publishing-about-prisoners-of-war/</guid><description>Starting April 5, Twitter will ban publishing &amp;ldquo;media showing prisoners of war published by government or state-affiliated media accounts&amp;rdquo; as part of their policy preventing content related to a person from being published without their consent.
This could impact coverage of the conflict by media outlets like Russia Today or Sputnik, which are notoriously linked to the Russian government.</description></item><item><title>Twitter clarifies its content suspensions rules and allows appeal</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-clarifies-its-content-suspensions-rules-and-allows-appeal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-clarifies-its-content-suspensions-rules-and-allows-appeal/</guid><description>Twitter clarifies that content suspension for copyright infringement only happens if the violation of its Copyright Policy is “repeated”.

Furthermore, Twitter introduces an appeal form.</description></item><item><title>Twitter steps up control on fake accounts</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-steps-up-control-on-fake-accounts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-steps-up-control-on-fake-accounts/</guid><description>In an amendment to its Community Rules, Twitter changed its section regarding account authenticity. The platform previously addressed only &amp;ldquo;impersonation&amp;rdquo; while it now targets all &amp;ldquo;false and misleading&amp;rdquo; identities, prohibiting &amp;ldquo;using false identities in a way that disrupts the experience of other users.&amp;rdquo; In its rules on platform manipulation, Twitter switched from constraining &amp;ldquo;account and identity&amp;rdquo; to preventing &amp;ldquo;multiple accounts and coordination&amp;rdquo;, replacing the mention of &amp;ldquo;fake accounts&amp;rdquo; with a ban on &amp;ldquo;creating a very large number of accounts&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;using automation to create accounts.</description></item><item><title>Unavailability of the French version of Instagram’s copyright policy</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/unavailability-of-the-french-version-of-instagrams-copyright-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/unavailability-of-the-french-version-of-instagrams-copyright-policy/</guid><description>Instagram seems to have trouble publishing its community rules on its French website since April 5. According to tests conducted by Open Terms Archive, some parts of the text are completely unavailable in French (the &amp;ldquo;What happens when I submit a copyright report to Instagram ?&amp;rdquo; page only shows an English version), or only partially translated (in the &amp;ldquo;copyright&amp;rdquo; page, the introduction and titles are in English, the rest of the text is in French)</description></item><item><title>YouTube adds health data to the information prohibited from being published</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/youtube-adds-health-data-to-the-information-prohibited-from-being-published/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/youtube-adds-health-data-to-the-information-prohibited-from-being-published/</guid><description>Since April 12, YouTube forbids the disclosure of another person’s “personal” data, and not only one’s “confidential” data.

It was until then intended for some NGOs, government agencies and users who effectively report content that violates the rules. It is now presented as open only to non-governmental organizations and public authorities.</description></item></channel></rss>
