After the previously listed cases, which include “you purchased or downloaded the content” or “you saw others post the same content,” Instagram adds that users risk infringing copyright if they “use an unauthorized streaming device or service (examples: a ‘jailbroken’ or ‘loaded’ app or service).</description></item><item><title>Instagram blocks data retrieval and clarifies what information it retrieves</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</guid><description>In November 2021, Instagram made several updates to its community rules, its terms of use and its privacy policy. Among the notable developments, the platform explicitly prohibits the sale or exchange of &amp;ldquo;non-medical or pharmaceutical substances.&amp;rdquo; It says it will remove all posts promoting such products, either for sale or to indicate personal consumption, except in a healing context.
In its updated terms of service, Instagram prohibits creating accounts or using them in such a way as to retrieve information without permission, especially in an automated way.</description></item><item><title>Instagram commits to informing in case of content removal</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-commits-to-informing-in-case-of-content-removal/</guid><description>Some progress: Instagram now announces that in some cases where it removes content, the firm will notify the user and explain their options for requesting a review. Such a decision could have an impact on accounts like those of the 14 French feminist influencers who took the social network to court last year. They accused Instagram of deleting posts or accounts without giving clear explanations of the reasons for these deletions, or tools to defend themselves.</description></item><item><title>Pinterest removes Privacy Shield notice without updating its modification date</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/pinterest-removes-privacy-shield-notice-without-updating-its-modification-date/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/pinterest-removes-privacy-shield-notice-without-updating-its-modification-date/</guid><description>Pinterest has removed a lengthy explanation of its data processing arrangements, which it said it was carrying out under the Privacy Shield then in place between the European Union and the United States. Until then, the company was committed to resolving any complaints about personal data processing and verifying as much as possible that its partners were also in compliance with the Privacy Shield. On July 21, 2020, this part was replaced by a simple sentence stating that personal data from the European Economic Area could be processed outside of it, without a commitment to manage complaints.</description></item><item><title>Protonmail clarifies its privacy policies</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/protonmail-clarifies-its-privacy-policies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/protonmail-clarifies-its-privacy-policies/</guid><description>On September 6, 2021, ProtonMail amended its privacy policies so as to clarify the effects of Swiss laws (where the company is based) on the handling of user data. So, while the company claims to offer a particularly secure email service, it may find itself &amp;ldquo;forced to share the IP address&amp;rdquo; of its users with law enforcement in criminal investigations.
The day before the change, the website Paris-Luttes.info and various Internet users revealed that ProtonMail had communicated the IP addresses of users linked to the Youth for Climate group to the Swiss justice system.</description></item><item><title>Qwant details data shared with Microsoft</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/qwant-details-data-shared-with-microsoft/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/qwant-details-data-shared-with-microsoft/</guid><description>On November 2, 2021, Qwant specified in its privacy policy the type of data it passes on to its partner Microsoft &amp;ldquo;for the security and reliability of its services.&amp;rdquo; Among the data that the service can share with Bing, the search engine of the American giant, are the keywords searched, the type and version of the browser used, or an identifier derived from the IP address and browser information.</description></item><item><title>Terrorists and their content banned from Twitter</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/terrorists-and-their-content-banned-from-twitter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/terrorists-and-their-content-banned-from-twitter/</guid><description>Twitter made clear that it will delete &amp;ldquo;any accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks&amp;rdquo; and that it may delete all third-party content &amp;ldquo;disseminating manifestos or other content produced by the perpetrators&amp;rdquo;.
The addition can be read in light of several terrorist attacks celebrated online by their perpetrators: the Christchurch attacks had been broadcast live on the networks, as well as the Baerum massacre and then the Halle attack.</description></item><item><title>Twitter adds form and statement of jurisdictional consent to its copyright claims process</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</guid><description>On April 13, Twitter added a new condition to the issuance of a notice of dispute: it now requests the signature of a declaration of jurisdictional consent, which varies slightly depending on whether the user resides in the USA or not. For a French resident, it will therefore be necessary to attach to their information the statement of jurisdictional consent: &amp;ldquo;I consent to the jurisdiction of any court in which Twitter may be located.</description></item><item><title>Twitter clarifies its content suspensions rules and allows appeal</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-clarifies-its-content-suspensions-rules-and-allows-appeal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-clarifies-its-content-suspensions-rules-and-allows-appeal/</guid><description>Twitter clarifies that content suspension for copyright infringement only happens if the violation of its Copyright Policy is “repeated”. Such a measure cannot “vary depending on the type of services” anymore. Furthermore, Twitter introduces an appeal form.</description></item><item><title>YouTube adds health data to the information prohibited from being published</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/youtube-adds-health-data-to-the-information-prohibited-from-being-published/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/youtube-adds-health-data-to-the-information-prohibited-from-being-published/</guid><description>Since April 12, YouTube forbids the disclosure of another person’s “personal” data, and not only one’s “confidential” data.

It was until then intended for some NGOs, government agencies and users who effectively report content that violates the rules. It is now presented as open only to non-governmental organizations and public authorities.</description></item></channel></rss>
