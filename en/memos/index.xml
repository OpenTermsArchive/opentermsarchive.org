The previous version stated that ‘Adult is not allowed in other ad types’, which include ‘native’, ‘display’, and ‘video’. The updated guidelines outline specific standards for ‘counterfeit policy’ and ‘trademark used in the text of the ad or keywords, as well as imagery contained in the creative’. The modification primarily streamlines the implementation of this policy across the various ad networks that Bing is operating.&amp;#xA;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p>Bing ▪ Privacy Policy ▪ January 8, 2026&lt;/p>&lt;p>On January 8, 2026, Bing &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/8e63f32d84a6d01f3174e6ab200b2432b1cbf821">extended&lt;/a> the scope of its &lt;em>intellectual property policies&lt;/em> to apply to ‘all ad types’, instead of just ‘Search’. The previous version stated that ‘Adult is not allowed in other ad types’, which include ‘native’, ‘display’, and ‘video’.

The modification primarily streamlines the implementation of this policy across the various ad networks that Bing is operating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the &lt;a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60367/-1">adult content policy&lt;/a> remains in place for search. The document specifies that adult advertisements are defined by the content of the ad copy and the target website. It also provides a list of countries that may be targeted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Search ads appear in search results on sites that use Bing, such as DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. This channel is not only limited to text, but also includes images. Search results being limited by the keywords used during interactions with the search engine makes them more reliable in terms of consent. On the contrary, other types of ads are prone to unsolicited displays of content. This partially solves the problem of displaying age-inappropriate content to young audiences. It also ensures that the search engine continues to serve as a conduit for web traffic through paid advertising.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The adult content policy makes it mandatory for concerned ads to be mediated by an age-gating mechanism on the publisher’s responsibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Age verification is a controversial issue in many jurisdictions. The efficacy of shielding youth audiences, the practicality of implementing such measures, and the potential for perpetuating surveillance systems are all matters of concern.&lt;/p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Telegram expands its age eligibility requirement to Australian users</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/telegram-expands-its-age-eligibility-requirement-to-australian-users/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>tam kien duong</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/telegram-expands-its-age-eligibility-requirement-to-australian-users/</guid><description>Telegram expanded its age eligibility requirement by adding Australia to the regions where users must be at least 18 years old to sign up, alongside the EU and the United Kingdom.&amp;#xA;The wording was also revised.

&lt;p>In the revised policy, information collected across Products will be used to personalise features, content, and ads in AI at Meta, among other Meta Products. The information will also be shared with other Meta Companies to personalise features and integrations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, interactions with AI at Meta and related metadata such as content and messages will be used for purposes such as personalising and improving Meta Products, promoting safety, integrity, and security, providing measurement, analytics, and business services, personalising ads on Meta Audience Network, undertaking research for social good, and sharing information with others, including law enforcement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Information collected from user activities on Meta products including posts, comments, audio etc, interactions with AI at Meta, and information from partners, vendors, and third parties, will all be used for the newly introduced purpose of developing and improving AI at Meta. Facebook removed the clarification that it will not share personally identifying information, such as username, unless included in messages to the AIs, with third-parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides the updates in use of data from AI at Meta, Facebook has also expanded information collection on users’ connections and interactions both on and off Meta Products, and on the online or in person use of third party products and services. The platform added data providers as a third-party public source for datasets which will now be additionally used for undertaking analytics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The policy no longer provides details of information used to decide which ads and commercial content to show. It also removed factors that influence the personalisation of Facebook Feed and links to manage it. The policy clarifies now that search engines and other third parties use public content about a user (name, username, profile picture, etc.) according to their own terms and policies, not Meta&amp;rsquo;s. Finally, for non-account holders, Facebook added that it can remove content that violates their terms and policies.&lt;/p>

Given this shift, researchers have &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/10/ai-chatbot-privacy-concerns-risks-research">highlighted&lt;/a> concerns such as privacy risks, manipulation using vulnerabilities, and a &lt;a href="https://bostoninstituteofanalytics.org/blog/meta-will-begin-using-ai-chatbot-conversations-to-target-ads/">lack of users&amp;rsquo; control&lt;/a> over their data and experience on platforms.&lt;/p></content:encoded></item><item><title>TikTok updates its Developer Terms to introduce Commercial Content Library access, clarify research purposes, and reorganize core definitions</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/tiktok-updates-its-developer-terms-to-introduce-commercial-content-library-access-clarify-research-purposes-and-reorganize-core-definitions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Asma Sifaoui</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/tiktok-updates-its-developer-terms-to-introduce-commercial-content-library-access-clarify-research-purposes-and-reorganize-core-definitions/</guid><description>TikTok updated its Developer Terms of Service with targeted but consequential revisions that clarified access conditions, introduced a new data category tied to the EU Digital Services Act, and restructured core definitions governing developer use of TikTok services.&amp;#xA;The update strengthens the acceptance clause by replacing permissive language with an explicit prohibition.

Where the prior version stated that users who do not agree to the terms should not access the Developer Services, the revised text now states that users who do not agree are not permitted to access or use them. This change sharpens the contractual boundaries around consent and access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TikTok also introduces a new defined dataset, “CCL Data,” referring to advertising and commercial content made available through the Commercial Content Library API. Alongside this, the company adds a new definition of “CCL Purposes,” explicitly framing the use of this data as supporting supervision and research into risks associated with online advertising, including illegal ads, manipulation, and disinformation with foreseeable impacts on public health, security, civic discourse, political participation, and equality. The Commercial Content Library API itself is newly defined and explicitly linked to &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R2065#art_39">Article 39&lt;/a> of the EU Digital Services Act, signaling alignment with statutory transparency obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, the Definitions section is reorganized and renumbered without materially changing the substance of most existing terms. Definitions for Developer Content, End Users, TikTok API, Developer Documentation, Developer Services, Sample Code, SDKs, TikTok Services, and TikTok Information are reinserted in a revised order, with minor wording adjustments but no substantive expansion of rights or obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the changes do not broaden developer permissions but instead formalize a compliance-oriented data access pathway tied to EU law, clarify enforcement language around acceptance of the terms, and structurally reorganize definitions to accommodate the newly introduced Commercial Content Library framework.&lt;/p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Instagram begins use of AI interactions to personalise experiences and ads</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-begins-use-of-ai-interactions-to-personalise-experiences-and-ads/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Saumyaa Naidu</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-begins-use-of-ai-interactions-to-personalise-experiences-and-ads/</guid><description>Instagram included AI at Meta as a Meta Product to which its privacy policy now applies.

&lt;p>Wikipedia also refined restrictions on disclosure. While users with access rights may still make limited disclosures when blocking fake accounts, also referred to as &amp;ldquo;sockpuppets&amp;rdquo; within the wikipedia community, or performing administrative actions, the policy now explicitly prohibits directly connecting temporary accounts to their associated IP addresses in block reasons or similar public contexts. Disclosures are framed as permissible only when reasonably necessary for enforcement or investigation, and IP addresses must be removed if later determined to be unnecessary or disclosed in error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The update also clarifies consequences for misuse. An unnecessary or mistaken disclosure alone is no longer framed as grounds for immediate removal of access. Instead, the policy specifies that repeated patterns, intentional misuse, or local community consensus are required to justify revoking access to temporary account IP addresses. Parallel language is added for users with manually granted access, aligning standards across access pathways.&lt;/p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Snapchat adds minimum age requirements in Australia</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/snapchat-adds-minimum-age-requirements-in-australia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Saumyaa Naidu</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/snapchat-adds-minimum-age-requirements-in-australia/</guid><description>Snapchat added Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) requirements of the Online Safety Act 2021 for users in Australia.

&lt;p>These modifications occur in the backdrop of the involvement of US tech companies as an extension of US diplomacy. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink">Starlink&lt;/a> is a satellite internet service provider operated by Starlink Services, LLC, a subsidiary of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX&lt;/a>, a US company owned by Elon Musk.&lt;/p>

Nigeria has been under scrutiny due to allegations of persecution against Christian communities. The United States has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/01/trump-nigeria-christian-persecution">threatened&lt;/a> to intervene. In late October 2025, President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-award-trump-its-highest-medal-gift-him-golden-crown-2025-10-29/">made&lt;/a> a visit to South Korea. Since then, South Korean airlines have &lt;a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20251205/starlink-service-expands-among-korean-shippers-airlines">signed&lt;/a> contracts with Starlink to offer in-flight internet to their passengers.

The update reorganizes the section under the new title “Civic Integrity” and introduces a clearer, more formal definition of what constitutes a civic process.

&lt;p>The revised introduction outlines the policy’s purpose as addressing misleading content that could affect participation in elections or other civic processes, including information that may confuse users about how, when, or where to take part. This reframing moves the policy toward a more preventive orientation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, the policy reorganizes prohibited behavior into clearer categories, replacing earlier detailed examples with broader groupings. These include misleading information about how to participate, misleading claims about requirements or officials involved in administering civic processes, and content that could suppress or intimidate participation. Several examples, such as claims about polling places being closed, police activity near voting sites, or disruptions at voting locations, remain present but are now integrated into streamlined categories rather than listed as isolated cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enforcement has also been rewritten. Prior statements indicating that X would apply labels to violative posts and restrict their reach have been replaced with a model that highlights Community Notes as the platform’s primary transparency tool. The update introduces a dedicated “Civic Integrity label” reserved for critical escalations rather than routine moderation, and expands the list of possible enforcement outcomes into a more structured but less prescriptive sequence. The section describing appeals has been rewritten as well, now stating that authors “can appeal” rather than “are able to submit an appeal”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, a new “How to Report” section replaces the previous footer. It directs users to the reporting flow through the “Civic Integrity” option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the revision broadens the policy’s scope, reduces specificity in prohibited examples, and reallocates enforcement toward a community-driven context rather than automatic labelling. This introduces more flexibility for X in interpreting violations while decreasing the level of detail previously available to users about how the rules would be applied.&lt;/p></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple updates App Store rules on data use, age-gating, external software, and loan app disclosures</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/apple-updates-app-store-rules-on-data-use-age-gating-external-software-and-loan-app-disclosures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Asma Sifaoui</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/apple-updates-app-store-rules-on-data-use-age-gating-external-software-and-loan-app-disclosures/</guid><description>Apple introduced several notable updates across its App Store Review Guidelines and Developer Program policies.&amp;#xA;Apple now requires developers to clearly disclose where personal data will be used when sharing data with third parties.

For apps offering embedded software such as HTML5 mini apps or game emulators, Apple maintains that all such software must follow App Store rules, and developers may not expose native platform APIs without Apple’s permission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new requirement clarifies that apps must provide age-restriction mechanisms when creator content exceeds the app’s declared age rating. This aligns age-gating rules across creator- and user-generated content categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, Apple updated its App Store rules to explicitly include crypto exchanges in the list of highly regulated services that must be operated by a legal entity and may require geographic restrictions, thereby tightening compliance expectations for apps handling sensitive financial activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple also tightened its standards for financial-service apps: loan apps must disclose all loan terms and cannot charge an APR above 36%, ensuring clear, enforceable consumer-protection standards.&lt;/p>

The policy also clarified that any graphic or disturbing newsworthy or educational content will include a warning screen.&lt;/p></content:encoded></item><item><title>LinkedIn shares data with Microsoft and its subsidiaries to train AI models</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedin-shares-data-with-microsoft-and-its-subsidiaries-to-train-ai-models/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Asma Sifaoui</dc:creator><dc:creator>Saumyaa Naidu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Matti Schneider</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedin-shares-data-with-microsoft-and-its-subsidiaries-to-train-ai-models/</guid><description>LinkedIn updated its Privacy Policy globally to expand the scope of personal data sharing across Microsoft services1. For example, LinkedIn may receive information about user engagement in Outlook, instead of only sending its engagement data to Microsoft.

For example, LinkedIn may receive information about user engagement in Outlook, instead of only sending its engagement data to Microsoft. The affiliates list now explicitly includes GitHub, Inc. among Microsoft-controlled entities under this personal data sharing agreement. The language regarding targeted advertising and data use across services has been refined to state that LinkedIn may use engagement data from its affiliates to improve ad-targeting tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within the existing purpose of AI features, LinkedIn added use of personal data points from profiles such as work and volunteer experience, people and companies you follow, and licenses and certifications, along with adding conversation data from Generative AI features (GenAI), member generated content, data related to service use, and inferences about users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ie-versions/commit/50dcbecfd7c391c0aaa4cf0db72ffc9763f85cd3">European version&lt;/a> of the terms and conditions gives more information on the data collected and intended use, owing to GDPR requirements. There, we can see that LinkedIn removed the earlier distinction of not using personal data for training and improving their AI systems for content creation. It introduced new purposes for personal data collection and use under the “Legitimate interest” legal basis: offering content-generating GenAI features to members, training these features, and improving LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s products and services. For these, it will use data from profiles, activities, connections and group memberships, but also &lt;strong>group activity and messages, inferences about users feedback provided on services, data provided when users request support from LinkedIn, and conversations with GenAI features&lt;/strong>. This change is applicable to residents of the EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland. LinkedIn allows users to opt out of having their data used for this purpose at any time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-ie-versions/blob/50dcbecfd7c391c0aaa4cf0db72ffc9763f85cd3/LinkedIn/Privacy%20Policy.md?plain=1#L513">UK version&lt;/a> of the changes also makes the usage of personal data for GenAI clearer, stating that uses include “train, fine-tune, and evaluate […] Microsoft’s AI models”. It also explicitly mentions, beyond “posts, comments, articles”, company page data and job postings, that “LinkedIn video you create, LinkedIn Learning Videos and Transcripts” are used for GenAI model improvements. This is in compliance with the UK &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/explaining-decisions-made-with-artificial-intelligence/part-1-the-basics-of-explaining-ai/legal-framework/">GDPR requirements&lt;/a> that specify principles such as purpose limitation and data transparency. This update reflects the raging &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/12/1123562/how-do-ai-models-generate-videos/">competition&lt;/a> on video generation in the AI industry, where state of the art models like Sora from OpenAI and Veo from Google need immense amounts of video footage for training. Researchers have &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information">highlighted&lt;/a> that this scenario could lead to numerous privacy concerns including collection and misuse of personal information captured through training data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The differences traced in the terms for different jurisdictions based on their regulatory requirements emphasise the need for cross-jurisdiction tracking and analysis of platform policies. It also highlights the varying levels of AI regulations and enforcement across jurisdictions and how platforms respond to them.&lt;/p>
