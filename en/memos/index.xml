&lt;p>The wording was also revised.

Previously, eligibility was described using the term “US viewers”, which was ambiguous and did not clearly specify whether it was based on residency or location.

These items can then be sent as tokens of ‘appreciation in real-time’ during vertical live streams. Items received by the creator, as &lt;em>Rubies,&lt;/em> are converted into Google AdSense credit at a rate of 1 Ruby per USD0.01. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AdSense">Google AdSense&lt;/a> is an online advertising program provided by Google platform.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AliExpress allows the sale of decorative plants in Poland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/aliexpress-allows-the-sale-of-decorative-plants-in-poland-france-germany-italy-and-spain/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>tam kien duong</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/aliexpress-allows-the-sale-of-decorative-plants-in-poland-france-germany-italy-and-spain/</guid><description>&lt;p>On January 4, 2026, AliExpress &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/bfe3524765ce18753a0799134da4a3f6153de9e6">modified&lt;/a> its Marketplace Sellers Conditions to &lt;strong>allow local sellers in Poland, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain to sell live ornamental plants&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>The update strengthens the acceptance clause by replacing permissive language with an explicit prohibition.

&lt;p>The update reiterates that temporary account IP addresses may only be used for investigation, discovery, and enforcement related to vandalism, abuse, harassment, spam, and other policy violations. It explicitly allows the use of IP auto-reveal functionality during investigations, provided the automatically revealed IP addresses are used solely for these enforcement purposes. The revised text also removes language suggesting that access must be strictly “as-needed,” replacing it with a clearer emphasis on purpose limitation and compliance with applicable local policies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snapchat adds minimum age requirements in Australia</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/snapchat-adds-minimum-age-requirements-in-australia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Saumyaa Naidu</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/snapchat-adds-minimum-age-requirements-in-australia/</guid><description>&lt;p>Snapchat &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-au-versions/commit/0ef0689dfbcb33848c2f3de747c04c154daabac3">added&lt;/a> Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) requirements of the Online Safety Act 2021 for users in Australia. In order to comply with the SMMA, where “users under 16 years of age must not hold accounts on certain services”, the platform will verify the country of residence and age of the user based on information collected. This would include date of birth, IP address, behavioural information about interaction with Snapchat, information about content created, interactions with My AI (Snapchat’s chatbot), metadata, and information about friends on the platform. Snapchat further requires users to undertake age verification measures using a third-party provider called k-ID. Snapchat will only receive a “yes/no” result on whether the user is above 16, based on which access will be granted. For users below 16, the account will be locked and Snapchat will not receive any personal information provided during the k-ID verification process. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TikTok will not be accessible to children below 16 in Australia</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/tiktok-will-not-be-accessible-to-children-below-16-in-australia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Saumyaa Naidu</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/tiktok-will-not-be-accessible-to-children-below-16-in-australia/</guid><description>&lt;p>TikTok &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-au-versions/commit/a0a6ba8e5aa366a0b4d914ac66077dcab2931c9e">added&lt;/a> minimum age requirements in compliance with the Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) law under the Online Safety Act 2021 in Australia.

The update has been made in order to comply with the Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) requirements of the Online Safety Act 2021 under Australian law. The SMMA prohibits certain age-restricted social media platforms from letting people under the age of 16 create or hold an account. While outlining its age-verification approaches, X has listed using existing information such as self-attested age, ID verification, legacy verified public figures, account creation date, and verified government or organisational accounts. When these are unavailable, X will use email address-based estimation to verify the age. If these methods are unsuccessful, the platform will require users to submit a government-issued ID, which will be used to verify their age by artificial intelligence systems.  &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>YouTube details out criteria for educational, artistic, and public interest exceptions to violating content</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/youtube-details-out-criteria-for-educational-artistic-and-public-interest-exceptions-to-violating-content/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Saumyaa Naidu</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/youtube-details-out-criteria-for-educational-artistic-and-public-interest-exceptions-to-violating-content/</guid><description>&lt;p>YouTube &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/c2052c3843124de40812bd065df9a842a62137f4">expanded&lt;/a> on its criteria for exceptions to content violating community guidelines.

The update reorganizes the section under the new title “Civic Integrity” and introduces a clearer, more formal definition of what constitutes a civic process. X now explicitly lists political elections, censuses, major referendums, and ballot initiatives as events covered by the policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The revised introduction outlines the policy’s purpose as addressing misleading content that could affect participation in elections or other civic processes, including information that may confuse users about how, when, or where to take part. This reframing moves the policy toward a more preventive orientation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apple updates App Store rules on data use, age-gating, external software, and loan app disclosures</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/apple-updates-app-store-rules-on-data-use-age-gating-external-software-and-loan-app-disclosures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Asma Sifaoui</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/apple-updates-app-store-rules-on-data-use-age-gating-external-software-and-loan-app-disclosures/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apple &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/e59f84cfc8f0f419c73833066c962ae3640e3410">introduced&lt;/a> several notable updates across its App Store Review Guidelines and Developer Program policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple now requires developers to clearly disclose where personal data will be used when sharing data with third parties.

&lt;p>The guidelines also add a new restriction stating that developers cannot reuse another developer’s icon, brand, or product name without approval. For apps offering embedded software such as HTML5 mini apps or game emulators, Apple maintains that all such software must follow App Store rules, and developers may not expose native platform APIs without Apple’s permission.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LinkedIn now allows violating content if it is educational or newsworthy</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedin-now-allows-violating-content-if-it-is-educational-or-newsworthy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Saumyaa Naidu</dc:creator><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/linkedin-now-allows-violating-content-if-it-is-educational-or-newsworthy/</guid><description>&lt;p>LinkedIn &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/vlopses-us-versions/commit/891a208f02e1b57bff516e4caa8a4ad5abeadb88#diff-88386d527dff09b9311f1e66713dff8eebbf339a52952a1b2376eb198d34a60fR44">specified&lt;/a> that it “may allow certain content that would otherwise violate these Professional Community Policies to remain on the platform if it is educational or newsworthy”.
