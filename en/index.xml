In November 2022, the European Commission has finalised a report using Open¬†Terms¬†Archive to conduct a large-scale assessment of compliance with the P2B Regulation. In January 2022, Open¬†Terms¬†Archive was cited as example in support of the TLDR Act (for Terms-of-service Labeling, Design, and Readability), a US bill co-sponsored by Congresswoman Lori Trahan (D-MA-03), Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Senator Ben Ray Luj√°n (D-NM) to enforce the publication of summaries of terms of use in machine-readable formats.</description></item><item><title>Impact on consumer protection</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/impact/consumer-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/impact/consumer-protection/</guid><description>Achievements In the first quarter of 2022, France&amp;rsquo;s largest consumer protection association, UFC-Que Choisir, detected several irregularities in French online marketplaces thanks to Open¬†Terms¬†Archive tracking.

While these approaches are necessary and valuable, they are inherently endless and fail to address the root of the problem. Exploiting vulnerabilities for political gains will always attract malign actors, outnumbering those interested in prevention.
The issue of disinformation arises from vulnerabilities in the tools that mediate the information environment. These vulnerabilities persist because fixing them conflicts with the economic incentives of large platforms.</description></item><item><title>Impact on personal data protection</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/impact/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/impact/privacy/</guid><description>Achievements In September 2021, press articles objectified their investigations with data from Open¬†Terms¬†Archive following the collaboration of Swiss provider ProtonMail with law enforcement.</description></item><item><title>Instagram adds a posting ban to protect copyright</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-adds-a-posting-ban-to-protect-copyright/</guid><description>On March 28, Instagram updated its intellectual property community rules, prohibiting the posting of content that ‚Äúfacilitates copyright infringement through unauthorized devices or services.‚Äù The text presents a list of cases in which users would risk infringing the copyright of a third party or even merely ‚Äúfacilitating‚Äù such infringement, even if they did not intend to do so. After the previously listed cases, which include ‚Äúyou purchased or downloaded the content‚Äù or ‚Äúyou saw others post the same content,‚Äù Instagram adds that users risk infringing copyright if they ‚Äúuse an unauthorized streaming device or service (examples: a ‚Äòjailbroken‚Äô or ‚Äòloaded‚Äô app or service).</description></item><item><title>Instagram blocks data retrieval and clarifies what information it retrieves</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/instagram-blocks-data-retrieval-and-clarifies-what-information-it-retrieves/</guid><description>In November 2021, Instagram made several updates to its community rules, its terms of use and its privacy policy. Among the notable developments, the platform explicitly prohibits the sale or exchange of &amp;ldquo;non-medical or pharmaceutical substances.&amp;rdquo; It says it will remove all posts promoting such products, either for sale or to indicate personal consumption, except in a healing context.

In November 13 2023, they implemented tailored terms for European and business users, added new functionalities, imposed use restrictions, limited liability, and established appeals mechanisms. These changes were supposed to be effective on December 14 2023.
This delay could be related to the delays in adopting the EU AI Act, which is not to happen before 2024.</description></item><item><title>OpenAI enables transfer of control of non-European accounts to their employer</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/openai-enables-transfer-of-control-of-non-european-accounts-to-their-employer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/openai-enables-transfer-of-control-of-non-european-accounts-to-their-employer/</guid><description>OpenAI stated that starting on December 14, 2023, they would notify organisations (e.g. employers) about individual accounts created with organisational email addresses.
