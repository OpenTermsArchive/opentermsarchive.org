&lt;p>Digital platforms hold immense power in forming global information flows, managing personal data and dictating business practices, and thus massively influence societal change. Open Terms Archive publicly tracks the documents that define how these platforms operate: terms of service, privacy policies, community guidelines… in different languages and countries several times a day, increasing their readability and highlighting their changes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bluesky moves DSA contact point from Belgium to Ireland and stops accepting requests in French</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/bluesky-moves-dsa-contact-point-to-ireland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/bluesky-moves-dsa-contact-point-to-ireland/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bluesky Social &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/b1a978f22b73067d9b08ea5cf37fd752fcc6139d">relocated&lt;/a> its contact point for the Digital Services Act (DSA) competent authorities from Belgium to Ireland.

&lt;li>Open Terms Archive is a brand name, not a common noun. It does not have a determiner.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is singular. It is not “Open Terms Archives”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It has spaces. It is not “OpenTermsArchive”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As often as possible, non-breakable spaces should be used to separate the three words, in order to avoid line breaks in the middle of the name.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The generative AI industry is a globally relevant target for Open Terms Archive, considering on the one hand that it is so emergent it is mostly unregulated and will thus evolve very fast; and on the other hand that its potential for societal transformation, disruption and harm are as immense as the new opportunities it will offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, several national and global regulatory proposals on AI exist, but none have been adopted yet: UNESCO’s “Ethics of AI”; Council of Europe’s “Convention of AI”; EU’s “AI Act”; White House’s “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights”; China’s “AI rulebook”; OECD “AI Principles”… Legal challenges on personal data handling arise, starting with Italy and France. The impact of these upcoming constraints will be observable in the evolution of the terms, and legislative drafting should be informed by the latest state of business affairs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Copy.AI stops abiding with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/copyai-stops-abiding-with-the-eu-us-data-privacy-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/copyai-stops-abiding-with-the-eu-us-data-privacy-framework/</guid><description>&lt;p>Copy.AI &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/GenAI-versions/commit/c8a3f106587decf0cb6b5e0ce7695929d153a856">erased&lt;/a> from its privacy policy its commitment to abide by the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the same update, Cursor also introduced a list of use restrictions, including bans on reverse engineering, resale, data scraping, and using the service to train competing models. &lt;strong>Users are required to not send any prompt containing personal or payment data, and to report any unauthorized use and cooperate&lt;/strong> in stopping it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Datasets</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/datasets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/datasets/</guid><description>&lt;p>The datasets listed here are public &lt;a href="https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/#collections">collections&lt;/a> within the Open Terms Archive federated ecosystem.

&lt;li>On 1 December 2023, the European Commission &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launches-new-database-track-digital-services-terms-and-conditions">officially&lt;/a> launched a new &lt;a href="https://platform-contracts.digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/index.html">database&lt;/a> based on Open Terms Archive to track the terms and conditions of digital services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In November 2022, the European Commission has &lt;a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d6a287b5-5116-11ee-9220-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/">finalised a report&lt;/a> using Open Terms Archive to conduct a large-scale &lt;a href="https://ppmi.lt/news-insights/ppmi-has-completed-early-evaluation-p2b-regulation">assessment&lt;/a> of compliance with the &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/1150/oj">P2B Regulation&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In January 2022, Open Terms Archive was cited as example in support of the &lt;a href="https://www.lifewire.com/the-tldr-act-could-help-you-make-sense-of-terms-of-service-agreements-5216643">TLDR Act&lt;/a> (for &lt;em>Terms-of-service Labeling, Design, and Readability&lt;/em>), a US bill co-sponsored by &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/">Congresswoman Lori Trahan&lt;/a> (D-MA-03), &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/">Senator Bill Cassidy&lt;/a> (R-LA), and Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) to enforce the publication of summaries of terms of use in machine-readable formats.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since September 2020, the French &lt;a href="https://www.peren.gouv.fr/en/">Center of expertise for digital platform regulation&lt;/a> (PEReN) uses Open Terms Archive as part of its toolset.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the first quarter of 2022, France&amp;rsquo;s largest consumer protection association, &lt;a href="https://www.quechoisir.org">UFC-Que Choisir&lt;/a>, detected several irregularities in French online marketplaces thanks to Open Terms Archive tracking. They requested and obtained the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-versions/commit/0184178ee2fffbd5283c50f114e3211667391b15">correction&lt;/a> of several non-functional links to cooling-off cancellation forms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In January 2022, Open Terms Archive was used as an example of feasibility in the &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2353">TLDR Act&lt;/a>, a bill presented to the US Congress aiming at forcing platforms to clarify their commitments towards end users.&lt;/li>

Exploiting vulnerabilities for political gains will always attract malign actors, outnumbering those interested in prevention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The issue of disinformation arises from vulnerabilities in the tools that mediate the information environment.&lt;/strong> These vulnerabilities persist because fixing them conflicts with the economic incentives of large platforms. Therefore, it is crucial to increase the costs associated with leaving these vulnerabilities open and provide incentives for their resolution. Alternatively, obligations should be imposed on actors to compel them to address these vulnerabilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Impact on personal data protection</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/impact/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/impact/privacy/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="achievements">Achievements&lt;/h3>

Among the notable developments, the platform explicitly prohibits the sale or exchange of &amp;ldquo;non-medical or pharmaceutical substances.&amp;rdquo; It says it will remove all posts promoting such products, either for sale or to indicate personal consumption, except in a healing context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In its updated terms of service, Instagram prohibits creating accounts or using them in such a way as to retrieve information without permission, especially in an automated way. This could have an effect on the work of researchers like those of the NGO Algorithm Watch, a research project of which having already been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook/">closed by Instagram&lt;/a> in the summer of 2021.

&lt;p>These modifications can be read in light of the recurring questioning of Facebook’s responsiveness to suicide cases.

The rewritten section is now called “hateful conduct” and removes the statement that hate speech “creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion”. It also removes every mention to “offline violence” that could result from online hate speech.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of all, this rewrite adds some clear permissions:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>We do allow content arguing for gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs (&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/a90e9d276cda1ca23878fd2b2df7cc066d549c20#diff-dd1aecfa753374588d9e40f891e39f556b365ad800c9713ef398255bc906aad0R1340">line 1340&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using “sex- or gender-exclusive language when people […] &lt;strong>call for exclusion or use insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality. […] Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech.&lt;/strong>” (&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/a90e9d276cda1ca23878fd2b2df7cc066d549c20#diff-dd1aecfa753374588d9e40f891e39f556b365ad800c9713ef398255bc906aad0R1297">line 1297&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Beyond these additions, another revealing change is the removal of bans on specific forms of hate speech.

So, while the company claims to offer a particularly secure email service, it may find itself &amp;ldquo;forced to share the IP address&amp;rdquo; of its users with law enforcement in criminal investigations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The addition can be read in light of several terrorist attacks celebrated online by their perpetrators: the Christchurch attacks had been broadcast live on the networks, as well as the Baerum massacre and then the Halle attack. After the Charlottesville attack in the United States in 2017, Twitter had been accused of not properly controlling violent speech, especially from white supremacists, and then increased its means of combating such publications. In the first half of 2021, Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/transparency-19">says it has suspended&lt;/a> nearly 45,000 accounts for apology of terrorism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Threads expands profile creation beyond Instagram users</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/threads-expands-profile-creation-beyond-instagram-users/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/threads-expands-profile-creation-beyond-instagram-users/</guid><description>&lt;p>Threads &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/5f308804ef652e4ae29de093eeadaa2ab34fcbbb">updated&lt;/a> its Privacy Policy to remove the Instagram account requirement for new users. Users can now sign up directly with their email address or phone number, instead of needing an Instagram account as previously required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the change, Threads remains a service &amp;ldquo;provided by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited&amp;rdquo; that &amp;ldquo;is a part of Instagram.&amp;rdquo; The update also specifies that &amp;ldquo;if you have created a Threads profile with your email address or phone number [Meta Platforms] won’t collect and use information from any Instagram accounts you might have&amp;rdquo; to personalize the Threads experience (including ads).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twitter adds a tool to report spam and impersonation</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-a-tool-to-report-spam-and-impersonation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-a-tool-to-report-spam-and-impersonation/</guid><description>&lt;p>To report tweets that are considered spam or impersonation, users previously had to go to the tweet and then use the &amp;ldquo;report tweet&amp;rdquo; feature. &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/france-elections-versions/commit/056ada5513abfade20cd73458e56e41abe2f80cf?short_path=3089779#diff-3089779674bfd306d704d6da138bf9e166d07e8145f5bb30e7998f2fcdf9cdcf">Now&lt;/a> they can use &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/fr/forms/authenticity/impersonation">a form&lt;/a> without having to have a Twitter account.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twitter adds form and statement of jurisdictional consent to its copyright claims process</title><link>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/twitter-adds-form-and-statement-of-jurisdictional-consent-to-its-copyright-claims-process/</guid><description>&lt;p>On April 13, Twitter added a new condition to the issuance of a notice of dispute: it now requests the signature of a declaration of jurisdictional consent, which varies slightly depending on whether the user resides in the USA or not.

The change was added as Twitter updated a longer explanation of its reinforced fight against &amp;ldquo;copypastas&amp;rdquo;, both in the &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/copypasta-duplicate-content">English&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/fr/rules-and-policies/copypasta-duplicate-content">French&lt;/a> versions of its Platform integrity and authenticity rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a rule should help limit astroturfing practices such as those &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2022/video/2022/02/02/comment-des-militants-d-eric-zemmour-gonflent-artificiellement-la-presence-du-candidat-sur-twitter_6112033_6059010.html">used by Eric Zemmour&amp;rsquo;s teams&lt;/a> during the French presidential election.
