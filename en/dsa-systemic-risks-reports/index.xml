&lt;p>Open Terms Archive now archives and tracks all DSA systemic risk assessment Reports across the &lt;strong>21 very large online platforms&lt;/strong> that have published them to date, creating a &lt;a href="https://opentermsarchive.org/en/dsa-systemic-risks-reports/">dedicated dataset&lt;/a> for this new type of document.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leveraging its open-source software, originally designed to monitor changes to online servicesâ€™ contractual documents, the team developed a new collection that automatically archives and tracks Systemic Risk Assessment Reports published in compliance with the &lt;a href="https://www.eu-digital-services-act.com/Digital_Services_Act_Articles.html">EU Digital Services Act (DSA)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
